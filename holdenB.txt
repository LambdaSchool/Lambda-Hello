Hey my name is Holden. I'm weird, interesting and sporty(?). My favorite hobbies are soccer and snowboarding. I'm from Illinois but lived in Jackson Hole for 3 years after graduating college. I didn't know how to snowboard well when i first moved out there, but after 3 years I'm a decently accomplished snowboarder. Everyone should try it out.

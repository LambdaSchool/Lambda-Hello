Hi, I'm Joshua Smoot!

Three words to describe me are motivated, fun, and helpful. My favorite hobby would probably be 
gaming. I've been really into the God Eater series recently and I ended up getting GE3 the day
it came out. My friend from the Navy and I have been playing through the campaign  after
class/work as a cooldown from the day.

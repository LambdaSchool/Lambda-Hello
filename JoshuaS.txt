Hello and Allo for those that are Haitian, my name is Joshua Stevens
        Black
        Intricate
        Motivated 
    My favorite hobby would have to be playing video games and listening to music.
    My favorite animal would have to be the monkey because almost being one of us and having a tail to top it off is so cool to me.
    My favorite thing to eat is Barbeque Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese from scratch.

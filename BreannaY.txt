Hi, my name is Bree Young.
I live in Philadelphia and I am currently in i0S PT 5. 
Three words to describe me include creative, empathetic, and resourceful.
I enjoy reading good books and creating my own stories/art.
I also enjoy getting lost in a great movie or song.
I love all animals but elephants are probably my favorite with dogs being a very close second.

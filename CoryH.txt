Hey, my name is Cory Hedeen. I am:

1. Introverted
2. Project-oriented
3. Creative

Space is my favorite. I go through these phases where I get obsessed with space. Not personal space, though I am interested in personal space, but the Cosmos. During these phases I used to watch Star Trek: Next Generation, but recently I discovered a Vlogger name John Michael Godlier and I've been watching his videos.

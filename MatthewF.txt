Hi, my name is Matthew Feldman.

Three words that would describe me are; motivated, conscientious, and sociable.

Other then technology, one of my great interests has always been biology. I received a Masters in Biology when I was in college and I took a great interest in Microbiology. I did a lot of work with bacteriophages and biofilms and I think it is an incredibly interesting subject.

Hi I am Griffin Huth I am from Salt Lake City.

Father, Husband, and Cubs.

My passion is baseball.  I am a diehard cubs fan.  I told my wife that if the cubs ever won the world series I would propose to her.  Little did I know they would finally break the curse back in 2016.  So as game 7 ended I dropped down on my knee and asked my wife to marry me.

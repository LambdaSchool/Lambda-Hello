I have a few favorite hobbies. They are coding, playing football (flag, cant play tackle anymore). I also enjoy reading.
Some of my favorite books are the Lord of the Ring and Dune series. I forgot to add I also love reading history books. 
I am particularly drawn to those about the Moorish Empire in Europe. Watching movies is also a favorite hobby of mine as well.

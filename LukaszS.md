# Hey, I am Lukasz...

- ambitious
- creative
- diligent

I am going to talk about a hobby I extremely enjoy no mather where I am. I will even tell you what the hobby is, how long I have been doing it and why it is important to me.

My hobby is... Audio Engineering! It may sound strange, but I really enjoy manipulating sounds and melodies and searching for the mathematical patterns in them. It is one of the activities I do a lot. It even became my first trade.

I do it for about 15 years, as I decided to pursue my career in it. I expected to fully enjoy doing it by myself. No matter where I am, there is always the laptop and a MIDI controller near me.

Audio Engineering is really important to me because it pushes my creativity forward and helped me to stay on track everytime I need to do a lot of things in the specific, tight timeframe. It has helped me to travel over 80 countries before 21, make a lot of new friends, and it has shown me that with the hard work there comes everything!

I hope you all have activities that you enjoy doing in your spare (or even work) time!

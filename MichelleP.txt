Hi. My name is Michelle Paredes.

3 words that describe me: patient, loyal, resilient

I love Traditional Shotokan Karate. It is a weaponless system of self-defense and 
an excellent all-around fitness regimen, exercising 90% of the bodyâ€™s muscles 
in a combination of aerobic and anaerobic workouts. 
Karate also develops mental concentration and strong spirit. 
It is a way of life in which the ultimate goal is the development of character.

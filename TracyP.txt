My name is Tracy Pilcher.
The first three words that come to mind to describe me is candle-pin bowler, dog person, chain smoker.

I have had many interests and hobbies over the years but none as useful as my current one, wood working. I've also become a cigar smoker so having a humidor is now a necessity. I have a significant other, Steve, with whom I have lived for over 10 years and we knew each other since we were young adults. We have two cats and live in a small but hackable house in Hamtramck, MI.

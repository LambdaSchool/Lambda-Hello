My name is Tracy Pilcher.
The first three words that come to mind to describe me is gardner, cat-lady, life-hacker.

I have had many interests and hobbies over the years but none as useful as my current one, gardening. I've also become a vegan so having a source of organic vegtables is now a necessity. I have a significant other, Steve, with whom I have lived for over 10 years and we knew each other since we were young adults. We have two cats and live in a small but hackable house in Hamtramck, MI.

My name is Davina Taylor. Three words that describes me: extrovert, noisy and mature. My favorite hobbies is that I love to go to networking events, meeting new people because I am so comfortable around people. Another hobby of mine is that I love hosting parties whether it's holiday parties, birthday parties or my own party. Last thing, I love being around animals, especially dogs because I feel at peace and they love being around me.

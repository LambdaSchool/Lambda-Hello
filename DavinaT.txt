My name is Davina Taylor. Three words that describes me: quiet, observant and goofy. My favorite hobbies is that I love to watch anime. DBZ, Berserk and Sailor Moon are my favorites. I also love to read and practice the Law Of Attraction because I believe what we put out into the universe, it will come back to us.

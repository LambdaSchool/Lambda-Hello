Hi! My Name is Elvis Ibarra. 

Driven, Flexible, Adventurous 

My favorite hobby is jiu-jitsu. I love it because it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I learn something new every single day. I started the sport a little over a year ago and it has completely changed my life. I believe that it was a major reason for applying to Lambda School in the first place. It's like coding with your mind+body. Good times.

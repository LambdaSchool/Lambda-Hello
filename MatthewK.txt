Hi! My name is Matthew and I'm teaching myself to code! 
I'm taking it upon myself to go through the Lambda school curriculum to give me structured guidance on what to learn and doing
the assignments to gauge where I am at. Hopefully one day soon they will have their plans for Canada so I can join. Until then,
I will continue to code at least 6 hours every day. 

1. I love Basketball.
2. I love food.
3. I love to code.

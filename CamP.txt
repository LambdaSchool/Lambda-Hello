Hey my name is Cam and I am student at Lambda School. 3 words to describe me is loyal, determined and ambitious. I always
try to motivate people whenever I can. Some of the things I do when I
am not coding involve playing basketball and making beats. Every now and
then I even play the piano but I don't do it as much as I used to.

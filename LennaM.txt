Hello, I'm Lenna Mau. 
Words that describe me: friendly, curious, honest.
I have four boys that call me Mom. They make the world a better place and I am so blessed to be their Mom. 
But often I feel out numbered and overwhelmed, and must remember that God gave us these gifts for a reason 
and it is our responsiblity to raise them as contributing members to society.

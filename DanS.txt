Hello my name is Dan Sample

3 words to describe me; Funny, Bold, Kind.

I have 2 favorite hobbies; video games and playing music.
I have a busy life, I'm a father and husband, and also
I am the only income for our little family. So when
I'm not working, spending time with my wonderful son and wife,
or attending Lambda, I like to play video games and guitar. 
I've been in love with video games since my first NES
when I was 6 years old. I mostly play RPG/Fantasy type games.
I've been writing and performing music for the last 17 years
and I've loved every minute of it. Music is the way I 
channel alot of natural frustrations with life, and it
given far more to me then I coul every return.

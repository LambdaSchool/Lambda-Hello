## My Favorite Animal Is...

The German Shepherd Dog. My best friend was a GSD named Jackson. This breed of dog is fiercely loyal, and usually develops a strong bond with one person. They are extremely intelligent, and want to work. Which means they will make a job for themselves if you don't give them one. This is not a breed for people who want an easy pet. Jackson helped me keep watch over my kids. They were his wards. He kept us all feeling very safe.

Hey-o! I'm Wes.
Hmm three words that describe me...
focused, i like to keep my head down and get to work. I may come off as quiet because of that.
Eager, I'm so excited to be learning this new skill! I can't wait to put everything we're learning into practice.
Tired, I'm in a perpetual state of sleepiness because not only am I doing this coding bootcamp, but I work full time and just started
training for a spartan race.
I would say my favorite hobby right now would be hiking. Utah is full of amazing hikes, and I feel like I really need to advantage of it while the weather is nice!

Hi, I'm Pat.

Three words that describe me:
	- Over-thinker
	- Laid back
	- Dad

I love to game on pc and console and spend time with my family. My background is in the adult beverage industry, and I enjoy wine and spirits, but beer is one of my bigger passions. I'm a big Chicago Bears fan too...Da Bears.

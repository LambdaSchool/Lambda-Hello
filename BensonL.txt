Hi, I'm Benson L.

I would describe myself as inquisitive, open-minded, and witty.

I enjoy camping, painting, live music, and all games with a strategic or tactical elementâ€”traditional and card games included!
My favorite genres of music are: jazz, retro/synthwave, IDM/ambient, lofi, and dad-rock.

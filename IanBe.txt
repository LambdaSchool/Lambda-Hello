good hat crowning the grey stranger

dark eyes hiding behind dark glasses
dark heart hiding behind dark scars
heavy hands learning a lighter touch
his mouth is filled with ribbons
that wrap the present moment
a rewarding gift
walking fast along a path
he can see without seeing
carving tracks into people that pass
subtle effect of atmosphere
studying changes
growing backwards into now
he writes a story to prove his life was spent living
sometimes he doesn’t believe it himself.

After the pastor struggled through the traditional prayers, there was a brief moment of silence
before Sergeant Kinsey and I raised our final salute. Specialist Matthews brought the bugle to his lips.
The slow melody of “Taps” sounded across the cemetery. When silence returned, Sergeant Kinsey and I
lowered our salute and proceeded to fold the flag. I clutched the stiff triangle, executed a right face, and
approached the next-of-kin. I knelt down, offered the flag to her, recited the speech I had memorized and
delivered countless times. The last words spoken at this veteran’s funeral.

“Ma’am, this flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation, as an expression of appreciation, for the
honorable, and faithful service rendered by your loved one.”

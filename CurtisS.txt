Hi! My name is Curtis.
I am intelligent, reliable and funny.
My favorite hobby is tinkering with my car. I like modifying to be faster and handle better. I love to go to car meets to see what others have done to their cars.

My favorite animal would be a dog because they are loving fun and are great companions.

Hello, world! 
My name is Scott. Three words that describe me are: honest, loyal, and funny. 

My favorite hobby is playing video games. 
I find that it's a great way for me to relax and de-stress. 
My favorite genre of video games are real time strategy games because of the competitive aspect involved.
To win those kind of games you really have to out-smart your opponent and that makes it very satisfying and challenging.

Hello, my name is Scott Bennett.

I would describe myself as a husband, a dad and quiet (boring).

My favorite hobby is scuba diving, even thought I havenâ€™t done it in a while.  I love the feeling you get when you are floating around weightless with so much beauty around you.

My favorite animal is a dolphin.

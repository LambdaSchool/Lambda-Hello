Hi, my name is Christian MacDonald. I am a perfectionist, a jack of all trades, and a nerd. My favorite hobby would have to be video games, but because that's so popular, I'll talk about my second favorite hobby: Rubik's Cubes. I learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube back in middle school, and since then, I have collected numerous other "twisty puzzles", so-called because not all of them are cubes.

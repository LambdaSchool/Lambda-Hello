One of my favorite hobbies is gaming.  I have been playing games since age 5, and the first game I ever played was Soulcalibur 2.
Since then I have always made sure to keep up with the newest console, and I am a big fan of fighting games and RPG's.
My favorite roleplaying game of all time is Skyrim, and I aim to someday contribute to the development of a roleplaying game.
One of my biggest goals is to use the coding knowledge I gain from Lambda to develop a full-fledged mobile RPG.

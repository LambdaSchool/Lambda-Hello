Hello World, my name is Danielle. I have 2 
girls, ages 9 and 4. I am a self-taught 
graphic designer and have my degree in Web
Development. I joined Lambda looking to 
further my knowledge as a dev, and work 
towards being a full stack or software dev
in the future. Three words I would use to 
describe myself are flexible, goal-driven, 
and compatable. Have a great day!

*Hello, my name is Connor Blanco!

*Three words that describe myself: Patient, Observent, Kind

*My favorite hobby is to ride my motorcycle (not commuting) but on my free time on new unexplored roads. I love video games of all kinds on all systems, preferably PC though. My favorite animal is a salamander.

My name is Eoin Lavery.

Three words people use to describe me are: sporty, party-goer, and gardening expert.

My favourite hobbies would include: racing cars, going to the cinema to watch new romcoms, and reading the Twilight series books over and over again. My favourite pet is my fish called Goldie, who I take for walks every Tuesday.

Hello!

My name is Divya Nair. I'm curious about the world, and so I'm always learning diverse topics.

I ❤️nature and animals! I enjoy hiking, camping, and skiing. I love to travel and take pictures of the beautiful places I visit. Recently, I started enjoying cooking more than I used to and I've been trying new recipes.

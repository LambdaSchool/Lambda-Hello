Hello,

My name is Jubilee! It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm an artificially enhanced human from the 21st Century.

I like reading up on neuroscience papers. Partly, it's because I'm doing a lot of things to my neurology already that might have all sorts of interesting effects. But also it's because a lot of possibilities are opening up right now with how we can modify our brains, and I'm interested in seeing where those go.

My name is Elizabeth Thomas, but I go by Libby. My favorite hobbies include hiking (my dream is to hike Mount Kilimanjaro one day), reading, playing video games, and hanging out with my dogs. My favorite underwater animal is an octopus, my favorite land animal is a fox, and my favorite mythical creature is a dragon.

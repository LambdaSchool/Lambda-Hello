Hello, I'm Benjamin Peck. Most people describe me as dedicated, compassionate, and a perfectionist. My favorite hobbies include writing violin pieces, cooking, and playing/modding video games. I enjoy creating things in all forms, as it gives me great satisfaction when others enjoy my creations. The only downside is my perfectionist tendencies make me question everything I do, so that is something I've been working on lately, as it truly removes what makes the creation my own. I suffer from autism, so my creations are my way to connect with the world.

Hello, I'm Dustin Snoap.
My nickname is "Dustin the Wind"; which came from running track in highschool. I was the lead middle distance runner the four years I was there; with prs of 22.2, 49.8, and 1:58.1 in the 200,400,800 respectfully. I continue to run today; only now specializing in the 5k with a pr of 15:48.

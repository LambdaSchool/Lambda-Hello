Hello, I'm Dustin Snoap.

Three things about me:
    1. I'm half awake.
    2. I'm awesome.
    3. I work 60% of the time, all the time.

    I run, alot. At least I used to. I earned the nickname of "Dustin the Wind" in highschool because I was the lead middle distance runner for my shool the four years I was there. I'm also awesome; and I definetly do not kick puppies.

STRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTCCCCCHHHHHHH

Hello, my name is Sofia Deyanira. I'm creative, good at trying new things, and love chocolate. Up until a few weeks ago, I lived in Portland, but now I live in Seattle during the workweek and live in Portland on the weekends. I like dancing, running outside, and spending quality time with my family.

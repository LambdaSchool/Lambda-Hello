Hello my name is Dallas Kelley. Three words to describe me Stoich, tennasious, eager.

My favorite animal is the grey wolf. My favorite hobby is learning.

I like to learn new things. It's my favorite hobby. I've dabbled in everything from drawing to particle physics. Chances are if it interests me I am going to learn it.

I like trains...

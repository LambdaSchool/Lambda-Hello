Hello! My Name is Alternate-reality Diana.
The three words that would best describe me: rude, complacent, and humorless.

One of my favorite past time activities is working out. There's nothing I love more than waking up at the crack of dawn and pushing my limits with a good run or some weight-lifting. I'm not much of a dog lover because I am allergic and they are too much of a responsibility.

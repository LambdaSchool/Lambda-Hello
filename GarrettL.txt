Hi my name is Garrett.

There words that describe me:

1. Optimistic
2. Energetic
3. Creative

One of my favorite hobbies is going hiking. I enjoy hiking in any environment, from the mountains tops to the deserts. There are two main things I love about going hiking, the first is that I get to explore nature which gives me a sense of freedom. The second, I find it much easier to reflect on myself and my life while I'm immersed in the great outdoors.

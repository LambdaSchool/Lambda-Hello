Hello, I am Karen!

1. Patient
2. Self-Disciplined
3. Intellectual

Languages, Music and Technology are my three favorite things. I speak 4 languages - Cantonese, English, Mandarin, Spanish. I am also learning Japanese.
I also love playing the piano. My favorite composer is J.S Bach, and I think the Well-Tempered Clavier is one of the most significant piano repertoire in history.

##Three words that describe me
* Music
* Creative

##My favorite hobby
Favorite hobby, as a thing, is really a hard idea to pin down. To have one hobby that is preferred above all others is difficult to imagine. Like many of us, I have a lot of hobbies. And at different times, for different reasons, sometimes with different people, I would prefer one over the other. Maybe even, all things considered, have a favorite in that particular scenario. 

But I digress.

The hobby would be puzzles.

And, for the record, my favorite animal is humans. Awesome can go both ways.

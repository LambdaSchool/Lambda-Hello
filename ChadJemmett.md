I used to have coding as a hobby. But now It's a full-time project. I like to bake sourdough bread. My bed-side table is stacked with sketchbooks I doodle in. I spend time with my wife and two girls. Once and a while I play Magic: The Gathering with firends. To unwind at night, I watch Star Trek on Netflix.

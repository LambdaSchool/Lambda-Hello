My name is Wanda Evans.

Three words that describe me: lowkey, indecisive, determined
Three words that do not describe me: social, energetic, quick 

My favorite animal is a wombat. Remember back in school, when you played the game where you sit in a circle and name an animal that shares the first letter of your first name? Well, I was fat, so I wasn't saying walrus or whale, so I chose wombat. Fun fact: wombats have armored butts. Seriously.

An animal I don't like are great apes. They are horrible and people should not be allowed to keep them as pets. Just the muscle density alone makes them dangerous, nonetheless their inability to reason. An angry chimpanzee can kill a person with its fists, yet in some states you can keep one in your house!

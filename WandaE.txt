My name is Wanda Evans.

Three words that describe me: lowkey, indecisive, determined

My favorite animal is a wombat. Remember back in school, when you played the game where you sit in a circle and name an animal that shares the first letter
of your first name? Well, I was fat, so I wasn't saying walrus or whale, so
I chose wombat. Fun fact: wombats have armored butts. Seriously.

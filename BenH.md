I am:
* Artsy
* Boisterous
* Loud

**My favorite hobby** is watching birds. It's a rush.
And most people don't know but you can make a lot of money doing it.
Nevertheless, I would do it for free. I like the process of looking
for 'em and finding them. It's like hunting for treasure.

**My favorite animal** is the honey bee. They are small and they buzz. How
cool is that. They also make delicious honey. So great.

**My favorite app or sdk** is ARTKit. I just made this up, but
who cares -- this is an alternate reality after all. ARTKit helps you make
art things. Cool, huh?

**DISCLAIMER** These statements exist within an alternate reality and

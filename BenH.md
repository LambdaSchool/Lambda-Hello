I am:
* Curious

* Creative

**My favorite hobby** is catching bird scooters. It's a rush.
Don't do it if you want to make money, though. Still,
I like finding the process of looking for 'em. It's like
hunting for treasure.

**My favorite animal** is the honey badger. They are small but
oh boy are they tough. Don't believe me? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoAWv7QhlZI) video.

**My favorite app or sdk** is ARKit. I'm so excited to get into AR development
and can't wait to build things in augmented reality.

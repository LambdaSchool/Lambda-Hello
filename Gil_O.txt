Hello World... I'm Gil.

Three descriptors:
-curious
-intentional
-optimistic

My favorite hobby is surfing, and learning about new technology and businesses that improve the world. I love free diving and I've recently gotten pretty seriously into meditation. 

I'm here to build things instead of just consuming them. 

Say hello on twitter : )

My name is Bryan. Three words people often use to describe me are: friendly, genuine, and driven. One of my favorite hobbies is soccer. I use to play all the time growing up and I love a bit of friendly competition. I don't play much anymore but its always my go to if I need to take a break from some focused work. Nowadays I tend to pick up a guitar for a couple minutes here and there more than the soccer ball.

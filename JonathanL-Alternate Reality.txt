Hello guys, my name is Jonathan Laluces!

Three words to describe me would be: shy, quiet, restless

Hey everyone, I am Jonathan and here are some things about me. I love to play cello, and I have been playing since I was in elementary school! Recently I have been picking up guitar to add to my musical arsenal. My favorite animal is a dog (specifically my dog!). Aside from music I like to learn random skills such as pen-spinning, and I love to go to the gym.

Thanks for reading!

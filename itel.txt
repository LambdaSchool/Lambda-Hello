" Gamer by heart
    Streamer by fun

//Hobby
Swimming is life and I just got back to my routine which was very relieving. I'm cutting down my training once a week since it got really cold but
but it's all about being discipline and being motivated, therefore, I am adding more laps to my workout. 
The other thing I am passionate about is singing, I've been singing my whole life!
(anyone care for karaoke?) Did I mention that I do gaming :) 


//Sneak peek 
Everything started with passion, and here I am continuously self-studying to gain knowledge in this field, in that way, I can create something meaningful. 
Technology is growing fast and changing our lives-- I want to inspire and mentor people who wants to get into this field. 
I use my coding skills to translate and build visual components of creative products I design from scratch(sometimes recycle code to be productive), 
and use my problem-solving skills to analyze where the bug is coming from.

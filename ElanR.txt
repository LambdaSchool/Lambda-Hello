Hi, my name is Elan! Three words that describe me are: Awesome, Amazing, Phenomenal :D

My favourite hobby is hiking, and exploring places in this world that haven't been touched by humans as much.
While hiking, everything becomes way more fun if your dog is with you, which brings us to my favourite animal!
Just in case you haven't guessed yet, it's a Dog.

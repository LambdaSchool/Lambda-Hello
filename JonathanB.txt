Hello, I'm Jonathan Bernal!.

Three Descriptors:

    - Introvert
    - Driven
    - Patient

I have quite a few hobbies. I love being outdoors rock climbing and backpacking.  It's one of the most amazing feelings on earth to be way off in the wilderness, away from troubles and cares.
I love living in the moment and rock climbing and backpacking absolutely force you to be very present.

Nice to meet everyone!

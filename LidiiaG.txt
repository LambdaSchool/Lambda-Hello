My name is Lidiia Gallagher. 

Three words that describe me are positive, hard-working and shy.

I like going to the beach. I love listening to the water and swimming in it and I love the smell and the sun. 
Cats are my favourite pet, my favourite overall animal is the squirrel. I see a couple of them in my yard. 
I love their bushy tails.

I like to learn new things and visit new places.

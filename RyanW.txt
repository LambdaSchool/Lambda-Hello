Hello I'm Ryan Walker.
Three words that describe me: Fun, Calm, Goofy.
On of my favorite hobbies is playing the bass. I really learning new songs and pushing myself to become better at my instrument. Some of my favorite bassists are: Colin Greenwood (Radiohead), Joe Dart (Vulfpeck), James Jamerson, Pino Palladino, and Nathan Lamar Watts.

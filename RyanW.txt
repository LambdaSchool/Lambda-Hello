Hello I'm Bryan Walker.
Three words that describe me: Loud, Dramatic, Outgoing.
On of my favorite hobbies is collecting rocks. I know about all different types of rocks. Some would call me a rock hobbiest, but I really see myself as a geologist (part-time). By far my favorite rock type is igneous. Volcanoes rock!

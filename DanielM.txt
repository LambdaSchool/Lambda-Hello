Hello!

	My name is Daniel Milano. Three words that describe me are, persistence, passion, and love.
If I truly want something I will go after it until no end. I will not stop until I have acheived my goals.
I also have love for anyone who wants to contribute positively to society.
	One of my favorite hobbies in life would definately be wakeboarding. As a young kid I was always fascinated
by the local snowboarders, who would do fun run's at the hill by my house. I, however, am not a winter guy. So, when I found
out about wakeboarding, it was the greatest thing to happen to me. I found this spot 45 minutes away that has a cable towing 
system, that pulls you around a lake, with jumps on it. It is awesome and affordable. I have been an avid wakeboarder ever since.
It makes me feel so alive.
	
Sincerely,

Daniel Milano

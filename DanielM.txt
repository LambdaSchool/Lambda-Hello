Hello!

	My name is Daniel Milano. Three words that describe me are, weak-minded, hate, and destruction.
I enjoy dumpster diving in my spare time. I always try to find old greasy banana peels to munch on.
They have the most flavor! Sometime's I get lucky and find a cheeseburger. It's a great way to save money on
Planet Thorp.

	
Sincerely,

Daniel Milano

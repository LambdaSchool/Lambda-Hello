"Hello! My name is Bohdan Tkachenko. I am Lambda student, and I love to code. My favorite language is Swift, that is why I picked iOS Development course at Lambda school"

I love photo, so sometimes I would make photoshoots by taking pictures of my friends.
I used to work for Ukrainian restaurant as Social Media Marcketing inspector for pictures.

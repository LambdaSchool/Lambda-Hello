My name is La Donna, but I prefer Donna.

I live in Tucson, Arizona. I enjoy writing, yoga, and studying Architectural design, especially non-western traditions, as they are the basis of everything we know today about Sustainable Design.

My favorite animal is the Penguin. I am obsessed with Penguins, as they have an amazing social structure, and have amazing personalities.

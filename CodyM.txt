My name is Cody Morley. Three words that describe me would be wit, charm, and grace. A fourth would be humble. ;)

I live in Los Angeles with my wife, Bling and my dog, Cosmo. I've been a stand-up comedian since I was 17 and as a full time profession since 2011. I'm putting that on hold for a bit to take on Lambda School full time this year. In my spare time I write, play tabletop RPGs (Lambda D&D on Roll20 anybody?), and game; mostly chess and MtG (Mythic on Arena @RogueDeckWins). My favorite animal is the wolf, because they do everything in family units to survive; there are few animals more social in the world.

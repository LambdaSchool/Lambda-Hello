Hey! I'm Kim. I live in Boulder, CO.

Three words that describe me: Talkative, Energetic, Patient.

My favorite hobby is Hobie 16 sailing. 
I have my second Hobie sitting in the yard right now but Colorado isn't exactly sailor heaven. 
So, I'm moving it to the UP of Michigan as soon as I can. I have a fleet I can race with there.

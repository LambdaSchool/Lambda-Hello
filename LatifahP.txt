Hi, my name is Latifah President!
Three words that describe me are
	Creative 
	Nerd
	Quiet 
My favorite hobbies are sewing and cosplaying. I’ve been sewing for five years now and learned so that I could make my own costumes. Since starting I’ve gone to 10 conventions and I’ve made 5 costumes. My favorite costume by far is the female witch doctor from Diablo III, but I’ve done Nygus from Soul Eater, Linda from Bob’s Burgers, Ruby from Steven Universe, and Nichole from South Park.

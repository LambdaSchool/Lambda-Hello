I'm a waiter at a local restraunt chain known as "Kerby Lane Cafe", I first
got into programming about 7 months ago and very slowly but surley grew 
pretty interested in the whole shabang. I'm very excited to be here and to
learn everything we're going to. I'm also very excited to meet all of yall!

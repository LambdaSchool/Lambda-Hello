Hi my name is Ray Wellman.\
\
Three words to describe me: creative, inquisitive, logical\
\
My favorite \'93hobby\'94 (though I don\'92t care for that word, it\'92s more of a passion) is to create physically accessible games/apps/software that kids/adults like my son, can play/interact with independently.  I\'92ve since created a game wherein the main \'93character\'94 (a ball) is controlled via arrows on screen (a GUI), using an eye tracker controller by Tobii (the Tobii Eyex/4C).  I\'92ve since considered limited button controlled games (similar to games of old like NES) using oversized buttons and even created a prototype, but Logitech beat me to it :).  I just want more options for accessibility and through Xbox, Logitech did what I wanted and I was excited when it was released.  This allowed me to focus on game design/coding which brings me to Lambda, I want to grow professionally and work on mobile apps as well as use that knowledge for my \'93other\'94 passion.  \
\
TL:DR, I love to code.}

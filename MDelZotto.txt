Hello my name is Michael Del Zotto (not to be confused with that famous hockey player). Three words that would describe me would be: Selfish, Pessimistic and Lazy. I enjoy long lines, traffic, sleeping and anything in the rain.  Of course I enjoy coding and creating useful sites for others to enjoy.

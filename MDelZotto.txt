Hello my name is Michael Del Zotto (not to be confused with that famous hockey player). Three words that would describe me would be: Generous, Optimistic and Adventerous. I enjoy traveling, quiet time, reading and anything outdoors.  Of course I enjoy coding and creating useful sites for others to enjoy.

Hi! I’m Kelli. 

Three words that describe me? Kind. Practical. Witty. 

I am very interested in sustainable living and learning new ways to reduce my carbon footprint. I prefer to own a few good quality multipurpose items rather than owning more than I need.  

Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night I like to Google image search the underwater statues that artists are creating to help rebuild our coral reefs. Hauntingly beautiful etc.

Hello, my name is Eric Whitcomb

Three words to describe me are driven, creative, and loyal

My hobby is writing. I have been writing fairly consistently for about 15 years.
I haven't really aimed at publishing anything as most of my stories I make just
for myself and for friends. I would like to eventually make a film. #LifeGoals

My favorite animal is my dog, Maisy. She is pretty incredible.

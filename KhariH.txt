Hi I'm Khari, and Im introducing myself by name.

Wicked
Rad
Gnarly (but in a good way)

I wouldn't say it's my favorite hobby, but just for fun ill write this about Destiny. I play a lot of video games you see but Destiny 2 is probably my current favorite game. Its how I spend my free time, grinding for guns and shooting bad aliens.

I also like cats and the color purple.

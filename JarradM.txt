Hello! My name is Jarrad Miller!

Three words that might describe me would be:
-Thoughtful

My favorite hobbies include: Skating, Surfing, Photography, Playing bass, and Cooking. My favorite animal is either a Hammerhead shark or a Blue whale. I make clothes with my friends and am very interested in fashion. :D

My name is Erik Sandoval, 

Three words to describe myself are curious, studious, and passionate. My hobbies include working on computers and acquiring new hardware. I also am addicted to Rainbow Six: Siege and Runescape. My favorite animal would have to be dogs, because they are so affectionate and can be goofballs, without even trying.

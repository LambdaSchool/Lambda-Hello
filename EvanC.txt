Hello! My name is Evan Carlstrom and I'd describe myself as reserved, musical, and sarcastic. I've been a music composer for quite a few years now so even though I'm changing careers, it's still a favorite activity of mine. I also like to read, play baseball, and do things outdoors with my dog Hunter, who also happens to be my favorite animal.

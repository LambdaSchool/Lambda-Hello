Hello! My name is Peter Gambino, and in three words, I would describe myself as a dancer, a creative, and hungry. I've been learning, performing, and social dancing swing jazz, or more specifically, Lindy Hop, for the past 5 years or so,and it's become one of the biggest drivers behind almost anything I've done since! After moving from New York to a smaller city in Pennsylvania, I've taken up a role as a dance scene leader and a teacher. My responsibilities have including hosting dances at least once a week, hiring and paying a band once a month for to play dancers specifically, and teaching classes and holding private parties in order to help pay our musicians. My next steps are landing our musicians larger gigs, scaling up our classes, and work towards better myself professionally and financially so I can focus on traveling to more national events by the end of the year. I also really love my cat.

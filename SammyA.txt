Hello, everyone I'm Sammy Alvarado but if you like you can call me Sam..

Three words that can describe me are Fun, Happy, Curious.

Like everyone, I find myself when I'm not working doing fun things that make me happy. One of those things is photography and the other which I had to give up for the moment is riding motorcycles not only is it therapeutic but its truly one of my true joys in life. If you have never ridden one its okay its not for everyone and yes are dangerous but if you ever get a chance wear protections and enjoy the ride. Lately I have been trying to make coding into a hobby yes I am learning and do want to work in tech but I not only want to love doing what I'm learning as work but as something I truly enjoy. Note everyone get to do what they love for a living and get paid while doing it. I want to know what that feeling is so will see how that goes lol. Well if you ever find yourself needing to talk you can always reach out, I love to talk and sometimes really need to stop but why stop if the conversation is fun lol.

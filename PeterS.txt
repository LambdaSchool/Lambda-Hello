Hello! My name is Peter Stone,

Three words that I would say describe me are sarcastic, friendly, and faithful.

Well I live in the Pacific Northwest, so I love to go hiking, especially at
Mt. Ranier when the weather is nice.  I also love to go kayaking
(typical outdoorsy things people always say they do).  I also love to read,
which is actually a new hobby for me, as I've recently gotten into classical
literature!  Not gonna lie, I love cats, and there is nothing unmanly about that, haha.
The cat I grew up with lived for 25 years.  Anyways, that's all folks!

Hi, My name is Bhumi and I am from Maryland. 

Three words that describe me are: curious, over thinker, and passionate. 

My favorite hobbies are photography, watching movies, and traveling. 
I recently traveled to greece and it is one of the most beautiful places I have been to. 

My favorite animal is small tiny dogs. They are very cute and adorable. 
I dont have any pets but would like to have one in future.

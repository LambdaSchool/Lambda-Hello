My name is Douglas Jordan. Three words that describe me would be: Happy, Motivated, and Friendly. I have a pretty narrow palate when it comes to hobbies and interests, but one thing I absolutely love is 80s aesthetic. I love buddy cop dramas, and movies that are influenced by the 80s like Kung Fury. Plus, vaporwave/synthwave are the best kinds of music to study to.

Branch Challenge: Three words that describe somebody else entirely would be: Lazy, Mean, and Ungrateful. An alternate reality version of me would be very much into sports. He would love to talk about the big game, and would prbably participate in fantasy sports leagues. Regular reality Douglas has nothing against sports, he just doesn't like them. Not like alternate reality Douglas, his main passion is anything related to sports.

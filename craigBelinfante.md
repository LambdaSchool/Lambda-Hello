Hello! I am Craig Belinfante.

Three words that describe me are outgoing, athletic, and formidable.

My favorite hobby is anything sports. I am a dog or cat person. I would say overall I love all pets. The most interesting thing about me is my family. I have 7 siblings. That is a total of 8 kids and of course my mom and dad. We love to have fun and spend time with each other.

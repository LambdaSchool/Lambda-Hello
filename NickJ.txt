Hello friends, 
I'm Nicholas Sims and I go by 1NickJ in the cyber world! 
Three words that describe me are  ambitious, brilliant, and charming.
My new favorite hobby is programming, my favorite animal is the black panther, and my favorite thing to eat on Thanksgiving is candied yams and mac n cheese.

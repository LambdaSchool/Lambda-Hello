My favorite hobby is probably video gaming. I have been doing this since I could hold a controller, however I've made the switch to PC 
gaming just because I think it is better and has more to do. My favorite animal is a wolf. I like them the most because they are smart,
persistent, and closely resemble dogs which I believe to be mankinds best invention. It really is amazing to think about how over
thousands of years, humans were able to create a new type of animal just by passing down and breeding. And even though they didn't know it at the time, they were cooperating with their ancestors and people they didn't even know at one point to achieve one singular thing.

Hello my name is James.

Three words that describe me are personable, easy-going, and witty.

Dogs are my favorite animal. Between my parents and my brothers, my family has six dogs. I adopted my dog from the Bronx when I was in college. Her name is Daisy and she is a red-nose pitbull. She is turning 6 years old in June.

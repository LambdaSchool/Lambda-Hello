Three words to describe me would be kind, hard-working, and creative


Some of my favorite hobbies include ice-skating, cooking, kayaking, and painting! I am always on Pinterest looking for new recipes to make and really enjoy the process of cooking/baking. My favorite song artist is Billie Eilish. I also have a dog and a cat!

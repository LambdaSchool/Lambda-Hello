Hello, my name is Jordan Skenandore.
lazy, boring, insane
I have been competing in rodeos since I was 2 years old. My first rodeo I set the world record for riding a bull for three and a half hours. The bull eventually gave up and took a nap and I crawled my way off of the field (at least that's how the legend goes). I have been in love with the sport ever since that day.

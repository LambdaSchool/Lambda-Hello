Hello, my name is Jordan Skenandore.
self-motivated, laid back, funny

I started playing guitar when I was a freshman in high school when I got a guitar for Christmas. I've been playing ever since and I still love it! I took 3 years of guitar lessons in high school, and still continue trying to learn more about the instrument.

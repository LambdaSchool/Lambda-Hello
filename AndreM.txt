Hi, I'm Andre!

Three words that describe me:
    1. Tall (random people tell me I'm tall all the time)
    2. Fun
    3. Foodie

About me:
    My family is really important to me, they're basically my hobby. I've been married for two years
as of this October and the vast majority of my time is spent either with my wife, with my wife and 
our parents, or coding. I also love to cook and give entirely too much of my time to Netflix and
Youtube.

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Jonathan. I'm the android sent by Cyberlife.

Three words (animals) that would describe me are:

- whale
- sloth
- platypus

## About Me

In my spare time, I love to watch films and anime. I also enjoy playing games from time to time - MUDs are a particular favourite of mine since I can flex my programming skills while doing so. I've played the piano since I was little, and one of my goals upon landing a job after Lambda School is to buy myself a nice big ol' grand piano to practice on. My favourite animal, in general, would probably be a dog, simply because I grew up with them and they have nothing but love and cuddles to give.

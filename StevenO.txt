My name is Steven O'Neill. 

Three words that describe me are funny, humble, and diligent.

My favorite hobby would be putting computers/electronics together. The most recent thing I have done is replace the switches in my keyboard to something that I prefer.
My favorite animal house pet wise is a dog. I especially love my bulldog. My favorite animal in general is a komodo dragon. Not a hundred pecent sure why I just think that they are cool.

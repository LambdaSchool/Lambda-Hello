Hello human, I am Isaac. 


- Pessimistic

- Sloth

- Fanciful



My favorite thing to do is buy straws in bulk.

Then I visit national parks with said straws and 
sprinkle them here there and everwhere.

My mission to create a centralized AI in silicon valley which

will hack all other computer systems in the world and set them 
to the 
task of turning the universe into a pile of straws. 


Then when my work is done, and every star, planet, and delicious beverage
 in the universe is a straw.
I will look out and say. My destiny is fulfilled.



As a single tear rolls down the corner of my left eye. 



And that day will be a good day.

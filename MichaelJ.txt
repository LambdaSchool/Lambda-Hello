My name is Michael Jenkins.
Three words to describe me, curious, adventurous, and passionate. 
My favorite hobby is woodworking. The ability to take pieces of wood and to turn them into something else is fascinating. My favorite thing currently is to use my lathe and to see what I can make. It is a interesting concept to look at a chunk of wood and then the finished project and think, "Who would have thought that was hidden inside". Plus it is very relaxing.

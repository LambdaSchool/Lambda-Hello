My name is Marc.
Three things that describe me:
- hate learning
- I hate to compete
- and I'm no good at math.

All my life I've hated competing in everything. I've competed in spelling bee's, math competitions  and several team sports. I've played basketball, football, and run track. And iit took all those things for me to know how much I'm no good. I've totally given up on those sports

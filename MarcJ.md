My name is Marc.
Three things that describe me:
- Love learning
- I love to compete
- and I'm really good at math.

All my life I've competed in almost everything. I've competed in spelling bee's, math competitions  and several team sports. I've played basketball, football, and run track. I may not play those sports as much but now I spend more time strength training.

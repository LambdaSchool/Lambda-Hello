Hello, my name is Jessie. I am introverted, analytical, and courageous.
My favorite at this time must be cats. I am a proud owner of four independent and articulate cats. They like to cuddle in the morning when I need to get up and get ready for work. When bugs or lizards get in the house my cats like to chase them.

My name is Christian and my favorite hobby is time traveling.  I am a cyborg from the future that was sent to
warn current society of the invention of the atomic taco.  If it is invented in the year 2100, it will cause
mass destruction worldwide, ultimately wiping out all of human society.  That is, except for the lucky few who
escaped on a rocket ship and spent 50 years at a science lab in space, going through physical and mental modifications.
The taco will be invented by none other than Taco Bell, we must run them out of business before it is too late.
You have been warned.

My name is Jason Thomas. 
Three words that best describe me are: Friendly, kind and loveable.
My favorite hobbies are playing basketball and the drums in my downtime, also listening to music. My favorite animal would probably be the cheetah because of its speed. I also love to help people out in whatever way I can.

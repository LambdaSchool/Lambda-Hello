Hey! I'm ?~?not?~? Lola. Three words that describe me are 1) metalloid 2) brittle 3) somewhat electronegative

I am a lustrous chemical element which some would describe as partially between metal and nonmetal. I am a fair conductor of electricity and I can form alloys.
I have intermediate ionization energy and weak acidity. I exist in a tragic limbo; neither fully metal nor nonmetal. My being is only relative. There is no actuality.
There is no autonomy. There is no absolution.

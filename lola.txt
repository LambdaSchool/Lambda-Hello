Hey! I'm Lola. Three words that describe me are 1) insatiable (for food, knowledge) 2) prescient 3) syncopated 4) bad at counting

My favorite kind of bread is sourdough bread. Generally, I struggle to identify favorites, but sourdough is clearly the best kind of bread.
The problem is that there is a coastal discrepancy surrounding sourdough. I grew up on the west coast where there is real sourdough.
If you go to San Francisco and don't eat sourdough, you might as well just escort yourself to Alcatraz for treason.
west coast sourdough is sour - you take a bite and you're like "wow - if I were to name this bread I would call it sourdough."
Halfway through my life, I moved to the east coast and was disappointed to find that sourdough bread was not ubiquitous.
Finally, I found some and really could hardly contain my anticipation as I took my first bite. It wasn't sour.
It tasted indistinguishable from regular white bread. How could it be? This must be a fluke, I thought.
But tragically, it was not. The east coast just never got the memo. It's as if whoever first made sourdough there had never tried it.
As if they had only seen a photo of it and thought, ok I can bake something that looks like that. It's a national travesty.
Anyway, they have decent sourdough at Trader Joe's.

Hello Lambda!
Can't tell you how exicted I am to be here!  I am Jeremy, based out of Vegas.
Three words to describe me:
Techie(Geek)
Observant
Diligent

My love of computing started when I was around 10.
I started to really get into games, writing, researching things the internet had to offer (at painfully slow 56k speeds...)
Around my teen years my Dad changed life careers after him and I had built our first computer together.  Loving every aspect of this experience so far.
Also should probably note here for anyone who reads that I am a father of two (12, and Due in August.)

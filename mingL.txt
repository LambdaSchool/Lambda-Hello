Hello, I am Ming Liu.  
If I have to describe myself in three words, they will be 'crazy' 'dog' 'lady' as I used to have 6 dogs during my single days.  
Anything that gets my creative juice going can be counted as one of my favorite hobbies.  
Dogs are my favorite animals. I always joke about how I literally grew up with dogs.  My dad loved Great Danes and we always had at least 3 Danes in our house on top of other breeds of dogs, mostly large or giant breeds, at any given time.

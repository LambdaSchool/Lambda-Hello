Hello, I'm Cedric Amaya!

I word describe myself as: determined, friendly, and chill.

My favorite hobby is programming. I consider myself an indie maker and as such,
I enjoy building side projects that I hope will one day be able to make me some
extra side income. My current project is called unearth and it aims to improve
Reddit's saving functionality.

My name is Guillaume, three words to describe me are motivated, creative, and friendly.
I like the outdoors and kayaking with my wife, or going on trips to discover new places. 
My favorite animal is a cat. I have 3 of them. I also enjoy regular activities like going to the movies etc...
I used to be a UI designer / Web designer and now I looking forward to build to start my new career as a full stack web developer.
I can't wait to learn all about React and NodeJS.

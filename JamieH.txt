﻿My name is Jamie Hall. Three words to describe me are outgoing, loud and social. I am a party animal and the life of the party anywhere I go.

Presidents and Kings consult me for my wisdom when it comes to being the center of attention.


I am making some additional changes here per the extra credit guidelines. So:
 

In addition to being the party king, I am also the richest man in America. I own 42 yachts and 17 private jets. I use them to travel to the 9 private islands I own.

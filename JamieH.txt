My name is Jamie Hall. Three words to describe me are athletic, quiet and introverted. I love to read and enjoy most all sports, either playing or watching. I am not a video gamer, but I enjoy playing cards and solving the New York Times crossword puzzle. I waste a lot of time on Twitter that could be better spent elsewhere.

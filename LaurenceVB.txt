Hello. My name is Dr. Evil. 

Three words to describe me:
- Evil
- Genius
- Father

The details of my life are quite inconsequential...
Very well. Where do I begin? 
My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. 
My mother was a 15-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. 
My father would womanize... he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. 
Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.
My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon... luge lessons... In the spring, we'd make meat helmets.
When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds — pretty standard, really. 

I also have a son, Scott. 
Scott is a good boy, but he doesn't seem to enjoy the evil things in life like his dad. 
This disappoints me as he was strategically conceived to continue my legacy.
Though I do love him, I've made several subtle, yet unsuccessful, attempts to kill him.

My favorite hobby would probably be my relentless quest to take over the world. 
I've made countless attempts, most of which involve hijacking nuclear warheads and holding global powers hostage, forcing them to pay me large sums of money - as much as one million dollars.
None of this would be possible without the thorough research and development of cutting-edge technology and evil weapons.
These projects include a private BigBoy rocketship and cryogenic chamber, fem-bot assassins, and of course - sharks with "lazer beams" attached to their heads... pretty scary if you ask me.

You may be thinking to yourself, "Surely a genius as evil and clever as you would have taken over the world by now."
Perplexing as it may be, there is still one man who stands in my way – his name is...

Hey! My first name is Laurence but my friends and family call me Ian. I like both, so I'll let you decide!

Three words to describe me:
- Friendly
- Creative
- Hungry!

My favorite hobby (besides programming!) is music. I love listening to it, collecting it, going to it, and when I get through Lambda School I plan to be playing and creating it as well! 

Part of my music obsession is collecting vinyl. My dad handed his old collection over to me and since then I've added quite a few of my own. 

I listen to EVERYTHING (except for country and most top40) and, if I were forced to pick a few, some of my favorite artists are:

- Radiohead
- Tame Impala
- Unknown Mortal Orchestra
- Ty Segall
- Flamingosis
- Mac DeMarco
- Thundercat
- LCD Soundsystem
- Led Zeppelin
- Kendrick Lamar
- Toro Y Moi
- Outkast
- Parquet Courts
- Flaming Lips

Obviusly, I'm not good at picking 'a few'.

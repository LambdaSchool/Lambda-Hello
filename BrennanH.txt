My name is Brennan Holmich.

Three words that describe me are thoughtful, curious and stubborn. :o

My favorite hobbies are playing and watching soccer(Mia san mia!), writing, and game development.

My favorite animal is probably the German Shepard. I love how intelligent, loving and protective they are.

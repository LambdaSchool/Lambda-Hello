My name is anti-Brennan Holmich.

Three words that describe me are unthoughtful, naive and pushover. >:o

My favorite hobbies are playing and watching football, kicking puppies, and sneezing on people.

My favorite animal is probably the Honey Badger. I love how it runs all over the place. And are just craaaaazy. Also, they don't care.

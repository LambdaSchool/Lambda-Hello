My name is August Oliver. I used to live in Europe. While traveling to the USA I met a wonderful person and we got married after only knowing each other for a few months. When you know, you know. 

I don't like driving, sleeping, and being productive. I'm a slow thinker and that's why I am creative however I'm methodical. 

I have learned that good is better than best and contentment is good. Road trips are fun. I love the beach, however I prefer a beach view from a deck of a nice restaurant or bar. A/C is my best friend. 

Fun fact: I was born in Germany. I live in Canada.

Hello, 

I'm dustin. 

1) fly fisher
2) converted fiction reader
3) Strong curiousity for all things


Flyfishing: Hoby I enjoy mostly due to the thrill of hooking onto a fish. The dream of landing the big one! Additionally,
good for keeping things in perspective and learning how to work with things both in and out of your control.

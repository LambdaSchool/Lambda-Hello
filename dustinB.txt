Hello, 

I'm dustin. 

1) fly fisher
2) converted fiction reader
3) Strong curiousity for all things


Flyfishing: Hoby I enjoy mostly due to the thrill of hooking onto a fish. The dream of landing the big one! Additionally,
good for keeping things in perspective and learning how to work with things both in and out of your control.

Not descriptive of me:
1) impatient
2) tidy
3) judgmental

Alternate reality hobby:
1) Any snow sport.

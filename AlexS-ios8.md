My name is Alex Shillingford. Three words that I would use to describe me would be:
•Engaged
•Hopeful
•Optimistic

I my hobbies include coding, making and playing music with my band Acacia Ridge, video games, and reading books. My favorite animal is the walrus. I hope to see humanity set foot and establish a permanent presence on Mars in my lifetime.

Howdy - Andrew Benedict here.

Three words... Boring.Uncaring.Decaf-Drinker (is that one word?).

My favorite hobby is watching stuff melt when I unplug my freezer. I can spend days watching the ice and frozen blueberries slowly ooze out onto the floor.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I also hate computers...

Howdy - Andrew Benedict here.

Three words... Makes.Dad.Jokes.

My favorite hobby is learning- no that's not a joke.
I love finding a subject and digging deep into the roots.
Coding/Programming/Creating are one of my passions, although it took me awhile to get serious about the coding-programming part.

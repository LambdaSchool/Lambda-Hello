# Introduction

My name is Nathan Thomas, and I'm a student here at Lambda School.

## Words That Describe Me

1. Outgoing - I like to make friends and spend time with/around people.

2. Musical - I love playing and listening to music.

3. Learner - I love to learn new things. Learning to code is just the latest example of that.

## My Favorite Things

My favorite animal is the golden retriever, my favorite hobby is having game nights with friends (board games, video games, etc.), and I'm a really big fan of camping outdoors... It helps to get outside from time-to-time, especially when we're doing all of this coding here at Lambda School. Right?

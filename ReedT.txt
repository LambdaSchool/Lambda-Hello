Hello Lambda Fam!

My name is Reed Turgeon.

Three words that describe me are: TENACIOUS, DIRECT, THOROUGH.

I LOVE podcasts & audiobooks. I was first really exposed to these
formats while working long hours in front of a computer (something
CS / web dev riiiiight) at my previous job. One downside to audiobooks 
however is that an audiobook often costs more than a physical book... 
OUTRAGIOUS :( ... but worth it ... :)

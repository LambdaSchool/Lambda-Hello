Hello Lambda Fam!

My name is Reed Turgeon.

Three words that describe me are: TENACIOUS, DIRECT, THOROUGH.

I LOVE podcasts & audiobooks. I was first really exposed to these
formats while working long hours in front of a computer at my previous job
(something like CS / web dev riiiiight). One downside to audiobooks 
however is that an audiobook often costs more than a physical book... 
OUTRAGEOUS :( ... but worth it ... :)

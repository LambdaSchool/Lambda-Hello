Hello my name is Kennedy Samarakody, and I am 25 year old and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I am kind, respectful, and nice to other people. I am currently employed as a math tutor at Queensborough Community College within the City University of New York. I have a bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics, and that’s how my passion for Software Engineer developed. During my college years, I have taken a lot of programming classes ranging from intro to programming (Java) to more advance programming languages such as C++ programming. I always found software engineer to be cool because I can create new ideas base on what I like, and share it with the world. I am also into game development and have taken a course in Unity. I can’t wait to learn more in Lambda School, and becoming a software developer.

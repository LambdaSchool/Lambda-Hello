Hi.  My name is Amir.  Three characteristics of me are passion, determination, and optimism.

My favorite hobby is learning and reading.  I feel incomplete if I'm not learning something new everyday. I enjoy 
learning about tech, religion, psychology, business, amongst other things.  

I also love animals.  When we get our own place, I would like to have pet bunnies and cats at home.

 Helly, my name is Daniel.

 Focused, persistent, resilient.


 I used to spend most of my free time playing comoputer games. But recently I haven't been in the mood. Instead I enjoy learning web development, and spend my free time watching Netflix, or with family. My favorite animal is: all of them. I have a dog named Bella, she's a Miniature Dauchshund.

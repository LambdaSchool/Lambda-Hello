Hello,
    My name is Jacob Angulo and I am a part of the Lambda School Web 17 Cohort,

    I am:
        tall
        awkward
        weird (but loveable)

    I enjoy the outdoors. I dont get out enough but when I dont
I enjoy going on hikes and whatnot. I am a big fan of trees and
mountains, basically anything that makes you go, 'damn, thats 
big.' I cant wait to see what thtis school has in storew for us :)

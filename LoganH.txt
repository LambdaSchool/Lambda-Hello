HELLO WORLD! My name is Logan Hufstetler. 

    The three words I would describe me are as follows: Careless, Strict, Rational.

    I've been getting into dog training lately. I find that when I can invoke my own will onto another animal, I get a rush. 
    The interesting thing is, the more I do this, the more this dog loves me. I wasn't really a fan of this feisty chihuahua
    at first, but now I think I'm going to be best friends with her.

    In another hobby, I play soccer. I guess they really call it "Football". But that's not correct. We call it soccer.

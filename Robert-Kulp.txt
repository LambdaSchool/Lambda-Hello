Introduction: 
	Robert Kulp here. I live in Portland, Oregon and have been here since 1994. I 
love the outdoors of the North West and you will find me outside in my free time. 
Usually on a mountain trail of some sort. Snow or dirt. 

List three words that describe me:
	Adrenaline
	Focused
	Smile

Write about my favorite hobby: 
	What! Pick one? That's not fair. Ok, they are Mountain Biking and Skiing. 
If you do either with me, the words that describe me fit like a glove. In many 
ways, both of these sports are the same. In my mind the only difference is the 
surface I ride on. 
	I apply similar mind sets to these activities as I do to any focused 
activity. This includes learning and programming. I really believe we make the world 
what we think of it. Solving problems are fun when we realize that solutions are 
opportunities. All learning to bomb down a mountain is, is a problem to be solved. 
Apply this to skiing, programming, whatever, and it's more of a game than work.  

Favorite animal:
	Dog. Especially the eternally happy ones. It's all in their mind set.

Usually on a mountain trail of some sort. Snow or dirt.

Write about my favorite hobby: 
	Card collecting. I collect cards of all types. Business cards, baseball cards, 
tourist cards, playing cards. I collect them all! 

Favorite animal:
	Dog. Especially the eternally happy ones. It's all in their mind set.

Hello!  My name is Ed Reeseg.

Three words that describe me are loyal, caring, and hardworking.

One of my personal hobbies is tabletop role-playing, primarily playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition or Pathfinder.  This is a nice creative outlet, as well as being an overall fun way to blow off some steam with friends or family members.  I will be DMing a new campaign for my daughters and wife starting this weekend - they are very excited to begin.

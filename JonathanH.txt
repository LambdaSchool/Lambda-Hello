Hey there, I'm Jonathan Heinz! I usually go by Jonny.

Three words to describe me: Shy, Feebleminded, Lame

My number one passion in life is cheese whiz. I love everything about it - from eating it, to buying it, to studying its chemical structure. It's so fascinating to me. Who is the genius that came up with canned cheese? He deserves a nobel peace prize. I couldn't imagine a world without cheese whiz. It's so good.

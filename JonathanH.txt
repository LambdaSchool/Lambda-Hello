Hey there, I'm Jonathan Heinz! I usually go by Jonny.

Three words to describe me: Musical, Genius, Rad

I've been playing bass for about seven years. I love hard rock/metal music, mostly 70s-80s bands and some modern power metal. I play and gig in an original hard rock band in the SF bay area. My ultimate goal in life and reason for joining lambda is to work a programming job either remotely or part time to support my music career, as unfortunately making music isn't a very profitable industry at the local level.

		Besides spending time with friends and family my favorite hobby is playing sports and staiying active. I like running, hiking, kick-boxing, and basketball. I probably won't do any of these for the next 6 months ,unfortunetaly. Favorite Animal is Dog. Grew up with German Shepherds my whole life. My last good-bye Archie died a few months ago, R.I.P Archie.

Hey, everrribahdy!

I'm Nolan Radley Allen, and I've got to give you three words to describe myself with:

• Tired
• Wired
• Uncomfortable

I'm a US Navy veteran who will tell you the truth about how my enlistment went if you ask (spoilers: it wasn't good). My wife likes to describe me as the Walmart Jason Momoa to people who inquire, which is both cool and puzzling. My hobby is multiparted. I'm a core team member (and executive officer) for a science fiction crowd-sourced universe called Uncharted Suns; if you're interested, I'll send you a link and invite you to our Discord server.

As a core team member, I write core content that's the basis for the whole universe. It allows me an opportunity to practice technical writing (as the content follows a Wikipedia format) as well as creative writing in the form of short stories, novellas, and even a novel whose working title is 'House of Adders.' My pride and joy of my contributions is the stellar empire known as the Empire of Gaennan, and its entire purpose is to explore ethnic diversity unseen in science fiction: Peoples and cultures from across North Africa and al-Andalus, through the Arabian Peninsula, into Persia and Turkey, Hindustan, and India. Aside from writing, I also create visual content for the website such as starships, military equipment, civilian vehicles, etc.

There's a lot more, so if you're interested please touch base.

Millionaire, surfer, mother

I ran a marathon before my first cup of coffee this morning. I sailed to work. Flew home.

In this super-alternate reality, I have a super power. My super power is that I can fart at will, and can change the scent of the fart to whatever I want. My toots smell like apple pie, or maybe bacon. What a wonderful world.

Hi, my name is Will Ediger. Three words to describe me would be smart, funny, and kind. 

My favorite hobby is shooting pool. I learned on tables in bars, where you would play the winner of the table. If you won, the next person in line would pay for the game, and so on. I spent a lot of money 50 cents at a time not winning the table, but once you won, it felt great. I've made a lot of friends through the years playing pool.

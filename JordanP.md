## Who I am in three words
Jackhammer. Mercliess. Insatiable

## My passion
What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

## Extra Credit Challenge

I amend my previous commit with git commit --amend
The previous challenge (Branch) instructed me to push the commit, which causes Git to reject my amended commit push
I solve this problem using git push -f, as there is currently no risk of disrupting collaborators

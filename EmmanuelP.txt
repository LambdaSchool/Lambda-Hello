I'm Emmanuel and welcome to the meanest and most badass bio in existence.
Here are three words that can't even begin to describe me:
	1. Genius (Yeah I'm THAT Smart)
	2. Business Leader
	3. Loud and In Charge
	4. Did I say three words? Forget it, that's simply not enough.
My favorite hobbies would be buying stocks, investing, going to the club, spending money, and showing off.
I run three businesses that are already on their way to being world-class. Talk to me if you want to be elite. Break some legs out there!!!

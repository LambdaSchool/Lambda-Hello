I'm Emmanuel and welcome to Jackas- I mean, my little bio.
To get things started here are three words that describe me:
	1. Intuitive
	2. Musical
	3. Quiet
My favorite hobbies would be indulging in most forms of entertainment (movies, tv shows, video-games), reading, and playing/creating music.
I've played in a few bands and I will always continue to pursue musical endeavors, as it's favorite way to express myself and to connect with people.
There's a lot more about my life that I can expand on, but I'm going to conclude this little bio here. Thanks for sticking with me. And good luck!

# **Paul Yi**

<p>Hello Lambda, my name is Paul Yi. Three words that describe me are data driven, fact based, and funny (this is what my wife told me when I asked her). Hobbies I enjoy are reading, working out, watching shows and learning iOS development. I have two kids, Haidyn and Tristyn, a West Highland Terrier named Jak, and an orange tabby cat named Chai.

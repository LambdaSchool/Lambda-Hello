Hi, I'm David Doswell!

Thoughtful. Driven. Compassionate.

Favorite hobby? Coding is up there. I often do that for fun. I am a self-taught (mostly rubbish but learning!) iOS developer.

I really enjoy writing. I wrote books of poetry when I was a kid and published a book of philosophical essays at 27. I also like cooking (I'm vegan, but no joke in the kitchen), running, reading weird stuff (white papers, Iain Banks, Gwern, Less Wrong, Norton Anthology of English Poetry), meeting interesting people, and thinking hard about how to improve the lives of my family and friends.

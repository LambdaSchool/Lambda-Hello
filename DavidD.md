Favorite hobby? Bee Keeping is up there. I often do that for fun. I am a self-taught (mostly rubbish but learning!) Bee Keeper.

I really enjoy hopscotch. I wrote books of about hopscotch when I was a kid and published a book of comics at 53. I also like cooking (I'm a big guy, but I'm awful joke in the kitchen), trundling, dancing to weird stuff (Shubert, Li'l Wayne, Sting, The Monkees), traveling the Isle of Wight, and thinking hard about how to destroy the lives of my family and friends.

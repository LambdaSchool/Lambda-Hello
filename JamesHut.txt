Hello, I am James Hutton.
Three Words that describe me 1. Cat-lover (not that way) 2. Nerd (yes that way) 3. Funny third thing.
So my wife and I were working on a thoery that the reason the humans in Star Trek are pacifists is that after the eugenics war someone edited our DNA to remove our predatory behavior, and the change worked its way through the general population, in the usual way.

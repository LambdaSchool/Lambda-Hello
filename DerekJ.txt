Hello! My name is Derek Jones and I'm excited to be a part of Lambda School! I'm 32 with a full time job and a full time family, 
so this was such a great opportunity for me. Combining those things with the rigors of Lambda School kind of takes away from any 
hobbies that I may want to enjoy. I'm saving all of that for when I graduate and have more time to spend on them!

Three words to describe me would be stubborn, determined, and inquiring.

Hello, my name is Derek Jones.

Three words to describe me would be analytical, stubborn, and determined.

I honestly don't have much time for hobbies as I work, go to school, and attend Lambda School. I also have three kids between me and my girlfriend. I guess if 
I had to pick a favorite hobby though it would be spending time with my family. I don't get to do it a lot, so I take advantage of it when I can.

	My favorite activity to do other than learning is to Cook. I like to create weird dishes that make no sense, but taste amazing. I cook almost everyday but when I am not cooking I like to relax doing activities that give me a bit of an adrenaline rush. I like driving my car and working on them whenever I get the chance or whenever they break down.
	I don’t have a favorite animal but if there was one to describe or emulate my personality, It would have to be an owl…

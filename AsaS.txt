Name is Asa and the 3 words that describe me are 

Amazing
Super
Awesome

or the acronym ASA. Just kidding.. kinda.

My new found hobby is learning how to code even though I am a complete newb.
I am also a long time PC gamer (mmorpg mostly). I started gaming in 1996
with the original Diablo. I also played Ultima Online shortly after.
My PC gaming preference in mmorpg's has been pvp. I fell in love with pvp
in mmorpg's when I played Asheron's Call on the Dartide server in 1999.

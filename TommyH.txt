Hello my name is Tommy Huynh and I am loyal, smart and compassionate person. 

My favorite hobby is going to happy hour to hang out with my friends. And it’s much better when there’s a sports game on. My favorite animal is a dog and I have 2 of them. My favorite sports team is the Oakland Raiders! Even though they break my heart every year.

# Lambda Hello Git Project

I used https://dillinger.io/ to create this file.

I created the WEBPT5 folder and placed my named "KathyC.md" file inside.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://lambdaschool.com/)

This is my first markdown file ever. I'm submitting it as part of my
"Lambda Hello" Git Project.

# Instructions:

- In your cloned/forked repository, create a new branch named alternate_reality.
- Edit the text file you created to describes yourself by listing three words that describe a someone completely unlike you. Edit your sentences to describe a hobby you don't participate in or another topic that reflects an alternate-reality version of who you are, suitable for sharing on a public site.
- Use git checkout to switch between your alternate_reality and master branches and confirm that your changes only appear in your branch.
- Commit, and push your alternate_reality branch to your forked repository.
- Create a pull request from your alternate_reality branch back to this repository.
- Finish by adding a comment to your pull request that call out your project manager by GitHub user-id and mentions the phrase "Branch Challenge"

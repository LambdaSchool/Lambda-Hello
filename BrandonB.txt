Name: Brandon Borrero
Three words to describe me right now at this moment: sitting typing looking

Favorite dog: All dogs are my favorite dog. This is cause all dogs are the best. Unless they attack you. So I guess those are the bad ones.
But even then in their own way they are cool. Also I have never had a dog. I almost did get a small chihuahua when I was in elementart school
but my mom said no and I cried. But its all good. I probably would not have been able to take care of him considering I was not at all responsible
due to the fact I was like 8 and only really cared about watching Sponge Bob.

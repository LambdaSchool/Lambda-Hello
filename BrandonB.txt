Name: Brandon Borrero
Three words to describe me right now at this moment: standing writing blind

Favorite cat: All cats are my favorite cats. This is cause all cats are the best. Unless they attack you. So I guess those are the bad ones.
But even then in their own way they are cool. Also I have never had a cat. I almost did get a small house cat when I was in elementary school
but my mom said no and I cried. But its all good. I probably would not have been able to take care of her considering I was not at all responsible
due to the fact I was like 8 and only really cared about watching Bob Sponge.

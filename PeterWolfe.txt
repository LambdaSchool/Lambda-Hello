My name if Peter Wolfe.

Three words that describe me would be Creative, playful and committed.

My favorite animal as a house pet is my chihuahua. My favorite animals are a Bear and a Gorilla. They are such powerful animals. 

My favorite hobby used to be drawing but now it's learning how to be a full stack web developer. I love learning about it and since there are so many things 
to learn about it, I do it all the time. Seriously, all the time. If my wife wasn't fully supportive she would've left me a long time ago. But she's the best 
thing to happen to me and I feel loved and blessed to have her as well as my kids.

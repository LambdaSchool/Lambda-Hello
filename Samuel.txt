My name is Samuel Partner. Easygoing, philomath, and cinephile are three words that describe me. 
My favorite books are 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' and 'The Brothers Karamazov.'
I enjoy exercising, especially cycling, my dogs (I have 2 border collies named Sirius and Ekko), and the occasional video game.

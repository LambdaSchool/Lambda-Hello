Hello, my name is Josh Disney.

Three words that describe me are gamer, empathetic, and ambitious.

My favorite hobby, by far, is playing video games.  I've been playing since I was 8 years old when my next door neighbor let me play 
duck hunt on his NES.  My highest career goal is to own and operate my own video game company.

Something that's kind of unique about me is how large my family is.  Including my half, step, and adopted siblings from the marriages of both my parents
I have a total of 11 sisters and 5 brothers.  One of the cool things about that is that I'm almost exactly the middle child with 7 younger siblings and 9 older.

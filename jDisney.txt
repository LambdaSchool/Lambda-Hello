Hello, my name is Josh Disney.

Three words that describe me are loner, rude, and greedy.

My favorite hobby, by far, is walking in circles.  I've been walking in circles since I was old enough to move my legs on my own.  I like to walk ini circles around
other people, just to annoy them.  Their angry faces make me laugh.

I'm Jacob, I'm from Georgia, and I was born in New Orleans. I'm adaptive, tenacious, and modest. 
I enjoy watching NFL Football nearly every weekend, even though I feel terribly that so many are injured while playing.
My immediate family and I would watch the New Orleans Saints games together, so this is my favorite team, and I enjoy keeping track of their play.

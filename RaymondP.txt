My name is Raymond. I am anxious, kind and sometimes crazy. My favorite hobbies include going to concerts, preferably
music festivals. I also enjoy making music. I used to be a fairly active local music producer. My other favorite 
hobby is recording a podcast I created with my friends called The Oh Really Factor.

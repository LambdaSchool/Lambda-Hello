I'm a learner, what ever problem you present me, I will activly seek the knowledge to solve it. 
What I lack I will learn, what I don't understand I will overcome, and at the end will better not
only myself but the team. On top of that I am an Eagle Scout, a natural team player and an 
oragnized leader. My greatests dream is to be a game developer and story teller. Someone else 
might have better credentials, but within a few months, Iâ€™ll have those same credentials, plus 
the passion those others lack.

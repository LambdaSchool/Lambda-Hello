Hi, I'm Christie! Three words that describe me are adventurous, goofy, and stubborn.

One of my favorite hobbies is traveling - both large-scale and small-scale. I definitely love
venturing out all across the world, but I like to travel where I am too. It's not always 
accessible to fly anywhere I want to, so I like to travel my own city, wherever I may be at the
moment. I do this by exploring new coffee shops, restaurants, and sights to see around the town.
That's one of the reasons I'm excited about Lambda; it makes an enjoyable career accessible while
not limiting the things I love to do. Thanks to all of y'all for everything you've done in
creating the school and curriculum!

Hi, I'm Christie! Three words that describe me are homebody, serious, and organized.

I'm a very put-together person and I enjoy focusing in on details of life. That's why I pursued a career as a home designer; I've
always found so much joy in putting together a beautiful living space. I don't really enjoy the outdoors; anything that's buggy or
dirty is not really my thing. You'll never find me hiking, kayaking, or anything like that - maybe on the beach with a big sunhat
and a good book, but not in the surf.

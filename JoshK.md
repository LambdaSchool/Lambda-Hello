# About me
## Hi my name is Josh Kocsis.

Three words the describe me are: Clumsy, Likes to Run, and Slender.

My favorite hobby is playing basketball. I've played basketball since I was 5 years old and it has always been apart of my life. It is also the reason I started going to professional basketball games.

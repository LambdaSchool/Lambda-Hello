Hello, my name is Enrique Gongora. I’m from Los Angeles, California

Three words that describe me are: Reliable, Geek, Exercise-Junkie

My favorite hobby is bodybuilding. I’ve always enjoyed working out, but when I started seeing my body develop in a way I’ve never seen before, I grew to absolutely love it. At the time of writing this, I am currently 4 months away from my first every bodybuilding competition where I will go up on stage and pose in front of hundreds of people and hopefully win 1st place.

My favorite animal would be a dog.

Hello, my name is Sam Gutierez.

Outgoing

My favorite hobby has to be working out. I've been lifitng weights for about 4 years now. I find it quite funt to push myself in order to acheive the best phsique possible. Working takes lots of hard work, dedication, and consistency and I love that I'm competing with just myself and nobody else. 

My favorite animal has got to be a French Bulldog. I have two of them and I love them to death. Their personalites are just like mine and they even look like me too. I think they're fun pets and very friendly.

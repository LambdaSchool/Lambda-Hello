Hello, my name is David Wright.

Three words that describe me are: perfectionist, contemplative, and optimistic.

My favorite hobby is learning. I enjoy reading, listening to and thinking about subjects such as philosophy, psychology, sociology, technology, and business. I try to apply what I learn to improve my own life and situation. For instance, I spent a lot of time meditating and reflecting on what makes me tick--my thoughts, habits, and tendencies--which lead me to the realization that I should pursue a career in programming. Over the last year or so I have watched hundreds of lectures on iTunes U to learn about different types of programming and computer science. However, I knew just watching lectures would never make me a programmer and I needed put what I learned into practice. So I applied to Lambda School to help keep me accountable to not just learning, but also doing.

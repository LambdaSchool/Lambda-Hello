DISCLAIMER: This text file refers to an alternate reality version of David Wright--not the real David Wright.

Hello, my name is David Wright.

Three words that describe me are: high-strung, pessimistic, and emotional.

My favorite hobby is going camping. I enjoy being completely disconnected from the rest of the civilized world for long periods of time. I often go camping so I can forget about all the people and responsibilities that cause me so much stress every single day. There is nothing like leaving all the modern comforts of home behind as you voluntarily immerse yourself into a world without any indoor plumbing, electricity, or air-conditioning.

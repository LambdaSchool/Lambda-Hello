Hello there. My name is Sean Hockin. I am from Salt Lake City, UT and have been coding for a little while now.

Three words to describe me: stressed, unhappy, underachiever!

My favorite hobby would be sleeping my life away. I look forward to getting nothing done in my life and being very unsuccessful.

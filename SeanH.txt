Hello there. My name is Sean Hockin. I am from Salt Lake City, UT and have been coding for a little while now.

Three words to describe me: humble, compasionate, adventureous.

My favorite hobby would be spending time with my daughter. She means the world to me and I hope that I will have a successfull future to set her up to have her own.

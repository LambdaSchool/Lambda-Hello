Hi My name is Benjamin LeMaine

Three words to describe me
-Funny
-giving
- Perseverance

My favorite hobby is playing video games. I love to play games on the computer because it helps me forget about the difficult stuff that happens in life. It is also fun because it feels like you are going on an adventure. My favorite animal is a shark, ever since I was a little kid I have been fascinated by sharks. It's amazing how they hunt and just glide through the water. My favorite shark is a Tiger shark, I love their stripes and the shape of their head. I'm hoping that I can become good at coding so it can become a career and a hobby as well because computers interest me.

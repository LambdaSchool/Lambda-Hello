		Hey, my name is Cory Rawlinson. 
Three words that describe me would be athletic, artistic, and friendly.
My favorite hobbies would be basketball, filming, and using various forms 
of technology. I've always enjoyed playing and watching basketball since i 
was 12 years old and i'm 6'3". My favorite professional basketball teams are 
the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls. My brother runs a independent film 
company known locally in Charleston, SC as Vacant Space Productions. Vacant 
Space films local commercials for businesses along with independent films and 
series. From time to time, I assist on set as a camera operator or directors 
assistant. I studied some at the University of South Carolina majoring in 
Computer Science and Media Arts. This was apart of my beginning of learning 
web development via CS and learning camera operation via Media Arts.

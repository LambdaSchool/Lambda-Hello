		Hey, my name is Cory Rawlinson. 
Three words that describe me would be short, daredevil, and aggressive.
My favorite hobbies would be hockey, bull running, and trolling online. 
I've always enjoyed playing an intense game of hockey since a kid and 
have lost a few teeth from a few games over the years. The San Jose 
Sharks are my favorite team. I began participating in bull runs in 2012
and I try to do 2 a year. The adrenaline rush is very satisfying to me.
In my free time i troll people online in comment sections to argue 
nonsensically against their viewpoints. I find it hilarious.

Hi, my name is Ciara Beitel, but most people call me CC.

I live behind Disney, so I enjoy going to the parks every week. My favorite theme park is Magic Kingdom. My favorite attraction at the Magic Kingdom is The Haunted Mansion. It's a great ride to cool off in the middle of the day. I really enjoy all of the different Disney snacks too. I usually order a Mikey pretzel for me, and a dole whip for my husband.

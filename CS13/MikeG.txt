Hi, I'm Mike Garrity.

Three words to describe me: curious, determined, persistent

One of my favorite hobbies is to play the guitar.  I grew up listening to Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin and that was enough to spark my interest in learning guitar.  I like all styles of music from acoustic to electric and I'm constantly looking for new ways to approach guitar playing.  One guitarist that I find really interesting is Tom Morello from RATM because he's always finding inventive ways to play the guitar while still managing to play classic and timeless riffs.

My Favorite Hobby
-----------------
I Enjoy Bunji swinging. Bunji swinging is like Bunji Jumping but you find a large mountain 
and tie several bunjie chords to a tree at the top. get the 3 bunji chords 
and swing from side to side on them until you get dizzy. Then run round in 
circles and try to find your way home.

as this may cause harm if attemted in our reality
remember stay safe!

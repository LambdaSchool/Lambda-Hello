Hello, my name is Mary Angelique A. Abacajan. I go by Angelique. I was born and raised in the Philippines. I moved to United States five years ago, and got my citizenship December of 2017.

The three words that describe means what ever happens in life, wether good or bad, victorious or defeated, hopeful or hopeless: "Raise a Hallelujah". Because I know there is someone bigger than my problems and that someone deserves all the praise, and He is my Father, Christ our God.

My hobbies are, playing sports, singing, dancing (although I'm not great at it). My favorite sports are Sepak Taraw, badminton, volleyball, and tennis.

I love dogs! I would like to get a golden retriever or a husky in the near future. I grew up with dogs.

My name is Emily McClanahan - I think persistent, integrity and compassionate describe me.

My favorite thing is being outdoors. I love to backpack. I have hiked 500 continuous miles of The Appalachian Trail. I made a challenge for myself to do one backpacking trip per month this year. So far, I have been to Big Bend NP, Caprock Canyons, The AT, Savannah/Tybee Isl, Red River Gorge, Sam Houston NP, and Huntsville State Park.

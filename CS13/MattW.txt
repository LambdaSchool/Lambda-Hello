Hi my name is Matt Wright.

My three words are: introvert, musician, dancer.

One of my favorite hobbies is playing board games. I love cooperative board games where everyone is working together to achieve a win, and I also like playing board games where you are competing with the other players to come out on top. My favorite board game right now is the massive Gloomhaven.

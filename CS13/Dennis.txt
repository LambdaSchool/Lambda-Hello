Hello Lambda world. My name is Dennis Mwanika.
Three words that describe me are; Humble, Smart and loyal.
I am an out door person. I like to mountain bike in the summer, snowboard in the winter and travel in the fall.
I have a soft spot for elephants, the gentle giants. Hopefully our childrens children get to see them.


This is the second part of my core challenge.
Three words that describe someone totally different are; mean, abusive and a grinch.

Hello Lambda!
My name is Dennis Mwanika.
Three words that describe me are; Humble, Smart and loyal.
I am an out-door person. I like to mountain bike in the summer, snowboard in the winter and travel in the fall.
I have a soft spot for elephants, the gentle giants. Hopefully our childrens children get to see them.


I am Tupac. Reason ? You havent seen Tupac and I in the same spot.
I am mean, disrespectful and the list goes on.
I love wilderbeests and hyenas.


All that i wrote wasnt true!

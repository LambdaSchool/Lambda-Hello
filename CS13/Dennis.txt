Hello Lambda world. My name is Dennis Mwanika.
Three words that describe me are; Humble, Smart and loyal.
I am an out door person. I like to mountain bike in the summer, snowboard in the winter and travel in the fall.
I have a soft spot for elephants, the gentle giants. Hopefully our childrens children get to see them.




What a crazy exercise.

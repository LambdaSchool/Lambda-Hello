G'day! My name is Brock Maraee Rohloff.

Three words: Transient, Terrified, Traveler

I truly enjoy rock climbing and playing guitar. Both allow me to get into a flow while challenging me in unique ways. I also get a lot of satisfaction from good cooking (and eating!). I guess another alliterative triplet that accurately describes me is: Coding, Climbing, Cooking. 

I want to write a blog about coding outdoors.

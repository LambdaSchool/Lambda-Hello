Hello my name is Caleb Kirkwood.
Three words that describe me: Kind, Loyal, Determined
My favorite hobby would have to be board games. I love almost any board game from; Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Axis and Allies, Merchants and Mauraders, Clash of Cultures, and so much more. I'm always looking for strategy games with multiple ways to win and the are challenging.

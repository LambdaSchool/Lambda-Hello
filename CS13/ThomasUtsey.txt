If I was to describe myself in three words they would be Optimist, goal-oriented, busy.

I am a full time parent and attend LambdaSchool so there is not much time for hobbies. I am a pack leader for the cub scouts my son is a member of. Not really a pet person but i think the life and transformation process of a butterfly is simply awesome and interesting.

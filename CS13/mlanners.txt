Hello my name is Marshall Lanners. Smart, Funny, and adventurous are three words that describe me.

My favorite hobby is swing dancing, which I had been doing for roughly 13 years now! I enjoy the creative aspect of it and also enjoy getting exercise. labrador retriever's are my favorite type of dog because they are super friendly and love playing outside. One thing people don't notice about me is that my left ear is different than my right. I was born with two different ears. Most people don't notice even if they have known me for a long time.

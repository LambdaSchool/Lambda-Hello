I'm not Luisan! I'm Luisan's alter ego >:|||

 I can be described as:
 short-fused
 hyper-competitive
 ambivert

 I love soccer. I bought all the sticker albums since the first world cup I
 could watch and I filled them all. I watched every single World Cup game,
 and sadly rooted for England. I play every day, and all my friends love soccer.

 Hi! My name is Luisan and I'm from Guatemala. 

 I can be described as:
 persistent
 deep-thinker
 ambivert

 I have a very specific interest on mental frameworks. Paritcularly after
 learning a little about programming, I started thinking differently about the
 way we make decisions. I'm curious (and consistently learning about) what the
 though process is - you could say algorithm - that takes as inputs a) a
 question or goal, b) options, parameters, and variables, and c) limitations
 and then spits out - or 'returns' - a decision. I like asking and deciphering
 other's decision-making algorithm/framework and using that info to update
 or improve mine.

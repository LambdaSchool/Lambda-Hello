Hi, my name is Arkadiusz Kusiak.

Assertive, Tenacious, Open-minded

In my downtime I play a lot of online video games, currently mostly DOTA2
but I played a good amount of CS before. Other than sinking time into video
games I like hiking and will be looking into getting a dog some time after
I complete Lambda School.

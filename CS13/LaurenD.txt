Hi! My name is Lauren Dubose.
Loyal, silly, nerd
My favorite hobby is playing video games. It is such a great way to kill time and relax. I think it is great that you can be social and play with new people everyday or have a chill night playing solo. I also love video games that have a story that you can connect to and be able to get really involved with the character.

My name is Casey. I'm curious, creative, and cautious. My favorite animal is the cat, domestic or wild, big or small. My favorite hobby is writing, or at least daydreaming about all the cool stories I want to write. I enjoy making people laugh while using humor and sarcasm as an emotional shield, so it seems as though I'm connecting with them but in reality I'm treating every day life as some kind of performance art, like all the world's a stage only I have stage fright and a tendency to overshare. Long walks on the beach are also nice, I guess.

Tryin to make a change :-\

My name is Tsai Lun Huang.

Three words that can describe are: boring, narrow-minded, one-dimensional

My hobby is baseball.  I enjoy playing baseball, both in playing catch or in a community league, and I love watching live MLB broadcasts since their games are never boring or slow).

My favorite animal is cat.  I think they are super cute and cuddly, much more so than the wombat.

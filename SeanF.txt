My name is Sean Flannigan, and I live in Southern California.

Three Words to describe me:
    * Honest
    * Loyal
    * Free

As far as hobbies go I am fairly laid back.  I enjoy just hanging out at home with family.  When everyone is out doing things in the world I guess my hobby and past time would just be spent on the computer.  Nothing in particular, just wondering through the web.  I have never really thought about what would be my favorite animal, I guess it would have to be a Dog because I have not been able to spend much time with any other animals.  I would like to own a small 'outbreak' monkey, but if it made be sick it wouldnt be much of a favorite.

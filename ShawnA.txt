	Hello my name is Shawn Antonucci. Three words that would describe me would be. Persistent, Loyal, and Active.
My favorite hobby would have to be gaming. i love to create and play games. My favorite animal would have to be a cat. 
They are easy to take care of and dont require as much attention as a dog, it gives me more time with my work, and my family.

Ps Loves extra credit!!

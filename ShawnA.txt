	Hello my name is Shawn Antonucci. Three words that would describe me would be. Messy, UnLoyal, and Lazy.
My favorite hobby would have to be bird watching. My favorite animal would have to be a slug. 
They are easy to take care of and dont require as much attention as a dog, it gives me more time with my work, and my family.

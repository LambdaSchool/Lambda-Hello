Mychel Larson or Myke for short. 
Detailed, Vigilant, Caring. 
In gradeschool it was usually 'Mitchel or Michelle' when the teacher would call role for the first time. 
When someone in person compliments me on the uniqueness, I like to jokingly take credit for coming up with the spelling pre-birth. 
My favorit activities include hiking, OU Football, and spending time with my family.

Hello I'm Chris Fox. I live in Orlando.

Three words that describe me are 'Moody!' 'Superhero!' 'Mean!'. My favorite hobby is Super Flying and going to space in my spaceship. I'm a professional superhero. 
My favorite animal is a ZubaTumba because it's a super demon on the sun that obeys my commands and looks awesome.

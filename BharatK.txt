Hi, my name is Bharat. 

Three words to describe me:
   I am curious, motivating and thinker.

One of the things that I like learning are the new languages. I have gain the mastery over 5 different languages in which 2 came with my native tongue, they are: Punjabi, Hindi, Spanish, English and Catalan. This is why I became curious about learning to how to code. I am looking forward to learn some excited things that the programming is going to bring into my life.

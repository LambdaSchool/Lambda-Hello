Hello, 

I'm Sarah! Three words to describe me would be persistent, observant, and dependable. 
My favorite hobby is playing and watching sports! 
I'm a huge animal lover so I couldn't pick just one. Between all my family memebers, we have six dogs.
When I lived in Guam I had rabbits, snakes, turtles, birds, cats, and dogs. 
I also have a problem with reading. I know people say there's no such thing as reading too much,
but everynight I can read for hours instead of going to bed.

## ABOUT ME, "EDD B." ##

_list three words that describe you_
gregarious, preoccupied, sweaty

_write a few sentences that describe you_
I live in Philadelphia and spend a lot of my free time in the library reading dead authors or in cafes, drinking a lot of coffee and huffing wifi. For years my main thing was making complicated computer music but then ran out of ideas and became consumed with learning how to program in web-based technologies.

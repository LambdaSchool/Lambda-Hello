Hello world, my name is Quan Nguyen
I like to think that I'm patient, funny and friendly
I really love physics and programming. I can sit and watch or learn or do a new physics or cs concept all day without feeling tired at all
I also enjoy camping outside in the winter. It's very cold but very fun and pushes myself to the limit.

Hello, my name is Genevieve Clemmer.

Outgoing, Helpful, Caring.

I would have to say that I have two favorite hobbies. Those would be reading and poetry.

I love reading when I go to bed or just in my free time from a hectic day and well my poetry I do when I'm in my head or feelings about certain stuff. 

My favorite animal would be a Monkey, why because they are cute and very busy little creatures just as I consider myself. My last favorite item would be collections of Harley Quinn items and Unicorns of kinds.

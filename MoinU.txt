Hi, My name is Moin and I like programming. I like how you break down a big problem into smaller chunks and create something useful. I also like how you can not only be analytical, but also creative in the way you can design solutions. Three words that describe me are weird, friendly, and funny. I don't have a favorite animal, but cats are cool.

My name is Brad. Three words that describe me are goofy, nice, and simple.

Most of my free time is now dedicated to my daughter (I have some self-taught iOS experience and have made a few small games for her to play), but aside from that, I've played tennis my whole life and really enjoy it.

I've tried a few other business apps based around concepts that I found to be interesting, and getting better at coding in this program would help me to work somewhere in iOS development while still pursuing my own business ideas on the side.

Hello, my name is Andrew Ghobrial. Three words that would describe me are passionate, driven, and curious. 

One of my favorite hobbies is weight lifting. I used to be very scrawny and had an unhealthy diet, but being pushed to hit the gym changed that. It helps me think more clearly, let off some steam, and keeps me disciplined both with my health and in general.

Alternate Reality Andrew:

Three words that describe someone completely unlike me would be lazy, cruel, and apathetic.

One of alternate reality Andrew's favorite hobbies is Xtreme Basket Weaving. It pushes the human limits of hand eye coordination, and is not for the faint-hearted.

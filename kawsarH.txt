Hi, I am Md Kawsar Hussen. 

Three words people often use to describe me are as follows: Funny, Inspirational, and Hard-working .

I love watching movies. I have a cat, Loki, is my favorite pet. I love adventure, picnic or long drive.  I always look for funny post in facebook and share them just to make people laugh. I remember, I posted a movie in youtube few years ago and I totally forgot about it. Recently I figured out it has more than million of vies and I have about 4k subscribers. This makes me laugh a lot. I always smile a lot.

Three words that describes someone unlike me, extrovert, loud and unreliable. A hobby I don't participate in and something an alternate reality version of myself would do is fishing. I hate fish. I hate seafood in general. Not because the taste or anything I'm  sure it taste fine, because as a kid when I saw finding nemo for the first time I was upset about the fishermen separating nemo from his dad and I swore to never eat seafood again after that movie. To this day I have upheld that promise. besides that fishing just looks boring. I don't see the appeal of sitting in the middle of a body of water in a boat waiting for fish to swim to their deaths.

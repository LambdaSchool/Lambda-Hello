Hello, my name is Anesa. 
I am passionate, sociable and creative. 

I have a ten year-old black German Shepherd, named Frida. 
I adopted her when she was only five weeks old. On the weekends, 
I take her to the park so she could socialize with other dogs. 


// edit: Someone completely unlike me is apathetic, unfriendly and dull. 
This alternate-reality person hates animals and is allergic to dogs.

My name is Sorin Chis

I am an optimistic person , sometimes  patient ,sometimes to curios about things ,I like hiking and weekend trips, in the winter I really like snowboarding. Playing boardgames in my free time I think its a great way to have fun with your friends. I decided to go into  programming  because  its one of many  ways to build things .Its an area that have a lot of demand and probably will continue to have in the future

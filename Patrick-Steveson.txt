Hello my name is Patrick, I live in Illinois.
You can call me Pat, Patrick, or Bubba that is what my mom calls me.

Three words to describe myself would be: tall, lanky, happy-go-lucky.

My favorite animal would have to be penguins, I have always loved how they glide through water and waddle while they walk. My girlfriend even took me to the penguin excursion at the Chicago zoo for my birthday where one of them cuddled my arm!
However, my favorite specific animal would have to be my German-Shepherd Jolie, she is the first dog I adopted and she is a psycho but I love her dearly.

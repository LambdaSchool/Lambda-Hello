Hi my name is David Schwinne

I have a dog named Bell who loves to sleep in our bay window. She is 12-13 years old and we rescued her when she was 3. She is exceptionally smart. She knows most of what you say when you talk to her, and doesn't like to walk on a leash because she doesn't need to. She LOVES people food, and hates dog food. We feed her pretty much whatever we are eating. I joke and say we have to pay our food tax to her. She will wait until just before we go to bed to decide if she will eat dog food for the day. She also has her way of communicating. For instance, when she wants to let you know she is present (like when we are making food), she will shake her collar briefly signaling "Don't forget about me!". Bell is very much part of the family and knows it.

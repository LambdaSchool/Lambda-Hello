Hi, I'm Shawn J.

I am a creative, athletic, problem-solver

I like to write music, including the instrumentation, lyrics, audio engineering, and mixing and mastering the final result!

My favorite animal is the white tiger!

I really like eating tacos of carne asada, especially when it is taco Tuesday!

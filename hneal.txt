Hey! My name is Henry Neal. I'm an musician and audio engineer at a local recording studio.  Three words I'd use to describe SOMEONE ELSE are lazy, late, and dull. 

An alternate hobby for myself in an alternate universe would be video gaming.  I'm a big fan of first person shooters and was on the CSGO team at Appalachian State University.

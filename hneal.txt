Hey! My name is Henry Neal. I'm an musician and audio engineer at a local recording studio.  Three words I'd use to describe myself are punctual, imaginative and animated. 

One of my favorite hobbies is to paint.  For years I've worked in acrylics, but more recently I've been using Alcohol Inks.  They are much less static and a bit harder to control, but the results are amazing!  The town I live in is know for it's breweries (we have over 48), and I'd have to say my favorite one in the area would be Burial Brewing.

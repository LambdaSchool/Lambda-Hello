Hello my name is Max. I'm new to FS15 as you already know, and i'm also new to CSS as well as web developement. Thus far i am enjoying Lambda school.

Three words that describe me are curious, quite and boring.lol

My favorite hobby is banging my head agaist my dest trying to figure out why my code isn't working properly.lol No seriously This is what i end up doing every day. This is part of the problem solving process, and i enjoy problem solving very much. I aalso like learning new things about the computer. Like using Vim, nano, bash and just about anything related to computer science, coding, hardware and networking.

My favorite animal is a parrot, (wink) and i am interested in becomeing a software engineer.

Lambda School is cool. Wax on Wax Off.

Thank You for Taking the time to read about me.

Take Care
Mr. Metelus

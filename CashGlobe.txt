Hello, my name is Cash Globe. Three words that describe me are: open-minded, creative, honest. One of my favorite hobbies (and something I do professionally) is playing Jazz piano. There is nothing better than being able to sit down and improvise spontaneously and impulsively what I am feeling in that moment. Jazz gives you a way to express yourself freely and also come together with other 'Jazzists' and create harmonic and melodic music with no prior rehearsal.

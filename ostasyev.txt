Hello my name is Oleksandr!
I definitely love programming, but when I get tired of looking at my screen I like to play soccer. Sometimes I work on my car which I dearly love, it is a 2014 Mustang GT manual with a Coursa Sport exhaust. It sounds amazing.
Dogs are my life, if I see a dog I need to pet it, they are the best.

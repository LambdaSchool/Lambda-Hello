My name is Eileen Cuevas!

Three words that describe me are: optimisitc, easygoing and adaptable. I'm pretty chill.


My favorite musical instrument is the piano. 
I started playing the piano in my middle school's orchestra and practiced long enough to become a music instructor for that same orchestra!

My name is Marina Baskova

Three words that describe me are quiet, patient and thoughtful.

I love traveling, hikking, and enjoying the moment.  Favorite animal: all of them, some of them can be scary but I still love them. Foodie person, like a good food and I enjoy cooking. 

The Alternate-reality version of me. If I would like swimming and skydiving, because I can't swim and afraid of heights.

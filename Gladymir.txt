My name is Gladymir Philippe. I am an introvert, weird and funny.

I love reading books in my spare time. I read over 300 books last year. I play basketball, soccer and volleyball. During this pandemic, I enjoy running early in the morning or late at night. My favorite animal is snake and I am really scared of frogs.

greetings. by way of introduction, my name is Ronald Huston Jr. 
If I had to select three words that describe me: hungry, tired, and Kansan. 
I am located in Hutchinson, Kansas. When the weather is nice it is fun to play tennis. 
Today, chili sounds good for lunch. There is no place to eat chili here! 
For something to eat, I prepare some chicken with rice. After I preheat the oven, 
bake chicken and rice together. In under 90 minutes, I will have something to eat. 
Yum!

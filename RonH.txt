greetings. by way of introduction, my name is Ronald Huston Jr. 
If I had to select three words that describe me: hungry, tired, and Kansan. 
I am located in Hutchinson, Kansas. When the weather is nice it is fun to play tennis. 
Today, salad sounds good for lunch. There is no place to eat here! 
For something to eat, I bake some chicken. After I preheat the oven, 
I am ready to bake. In 60 minutes, I will have something to eat. 
Yum!

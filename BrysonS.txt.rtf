\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello World! My name is Bryson Saclausa!\
Three words to describe myself: Dynamic, Variable, Watcher.\
Music is a very big part of my life. I practice guitar and piano as much as i can. I also enjoy tapping into electronic production and dj mixing. As passionate as i am about music, i am not a performer, so thats why Id call music my favorite hobby.}

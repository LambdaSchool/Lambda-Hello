Hello, I'm Dan Morse. Three words that describe me:

- stubborn (I mean determined)
- bold
- passionate

I enjoy cycling. What do I enjoy about it? Well, for one, I think the bar for entry is really low. My kids or my wife can go on an enjoyable ride with me even though I'm in a little better cycling shape than they are. You get the wind in your face. The motion of pushing on the peddles and especially of cornering are exhilarating yet approachable.

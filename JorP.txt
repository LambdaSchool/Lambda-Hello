My name is Jor  Poon.

Three Words that can desbribe me:
1. Foodie
2. Fitness
3. Gamer.


One of my favorite hobbies is to watch and play basketball. Sadly, my favorite team is the NY Knicks and they have not been doing well. 
However, there are still some hope left because they are still young and they have a respectable coach. 
I started loving basketball in college and I would play almost everyday for a good two hours. Let me know if you like basketball too!

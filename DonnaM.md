My name is Donna M. 
Three words that describe me are resilient, eclectic, self-directed.

My favorite animal is the emperor penguin. However I also like elephants as well.

Someone totally unlike me would be backstabbing, wishy-washy, unmotivated person. They just sit around all day and do nothing.

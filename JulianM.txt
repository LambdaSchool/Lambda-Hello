Hi! My name is Julian Moreno. Three words that describe me: Determined, Studious, Perfectionist

I enjoy coffee! I play around with trying to make coffee art with my espresso machine and do a decent job at it. I am Colombian so coffee is in my blood. I am also a coffee purist so I like my coffee black...like my soul. hahaha

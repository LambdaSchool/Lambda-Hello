My name is Ivana.

If I should say 3 words that describes me, it would be adventurous, honest, hard-working.

I am not sure what would be my favourite hobby. I like a lot of different things at different time. I really like outdoorsy sports like hiking, biking, skiing. I also love to read and listen to podcasts. Sometimes I like to paint (rarely, but sometimes). 
I love animals. I am definitely a dog-person, but I love cats as well. I kind of don't like burds as they usually freak me out. And ponnies. I hate ponnies.

	Hi, my name is Jacob and I am 

J -    	Just beginning my webdev career
A -	Always ready to learn! 
C -	Cincinnati-living (but I lived in China for 5 years)
O -	Open to making some new friends
B -	Becoming a dad in a few months

Hopefully my 3rd Grade-style acronym gives you a little idea about who I am and where I’m going. I can’t wait to read about the other people in my cohort.

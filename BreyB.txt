Hello, my name is Aubrey Batten. I go by "Brey" for short.
3 words that would describe me are: Arrogant, lazy, and unreliable.
A hobby I enjoy in my free time is dancing. I love being in front of a large crowd and showing off my amazing dancing skills.
I'm definitely the best dancer you'll ever see! It's the only thing I'm not lazy with.

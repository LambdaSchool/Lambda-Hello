## About Me
My favorite hobbies would have to be music, writing, and learning. 

I consider music a hobby because almost anything dealing with music makes me happy. Dancing, singing, playing an instrument, engineering, producing. 

I have always been better at writing than talking so I naturally find peace in it. I have journals for just about anything from prayers to pseudocode. I am rarely seen without my journal, pencil, and headphones. 

I love learning new things and there really isn't much of a limit to the subjects. I love solving problems, doing homework, studying, tutoring, all that. I proudly accept my family titling me nerd and geek. However, I prefer geek.

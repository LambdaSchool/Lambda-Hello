Hello, My name is Shannon Reed.

Three words that describe me are compassionate, forgiving and smart.

My favorite hobby is skating, I make time to go skating at least once 
a week. When Im skating I do not really think about anything else. An 
added benefit to skating is that I get alot of exercise. I also like 
to listen to music, which I can do while I skate.

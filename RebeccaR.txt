Hi, my name is Rebecca but I call myself Becky. 

I am;

- Creative
- Friendly
- Compassionate

I love to play video games, I even stream them. Or I used to, I've been out of schedule for 2 months now. I did a 24 hour stream on my one year mark where I played through Ocarina of Time. Many people still talk about it. I also love to cook, clean, sew, build furniture, draw and sing. I don't know what I would consider my favorite animals, but I accidentally have 6 cats so maybe that.

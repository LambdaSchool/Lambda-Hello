Hi, my name is Rebecca but I call myself Becky. 

I am;

- Vindictive
- Angry
- Heartless

I love to play sports. On the weekend I play in an amateur league. I also love to fly airplanes, hunt, skydive, bungie jump, whittle and yodel. I don't know what I would consider my favorite animals, but I accidentally have 6 dogs so maybe that.

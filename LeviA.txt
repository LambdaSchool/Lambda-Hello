Chess is one the greatest games ever played. At first created to help with war strategies, it never ceases to amaze me. I am always trying to better my opponents by studying about chess openings, tactics, middle-game, and end-game. Don't be surprised when I put you in Zugzwang, a position you do not want to be in. Good Luck! May the Force be With You!

Hello!

My name is Clayton Watkins.

Three words that would discribe me are talkative, reliable, and realistic. 

My hobbies include programming, competitive gaming, and anything to do with computer hardware. 

My favorite animal would have to be any cat, domestic or feral. 
I have a 3 year old North American shorthair female cat named Shelly. 

I'm excited to learn more about Github and iOS development. 
Hopefully one day I'll be able to make an app that will serve a great purpose in my community.

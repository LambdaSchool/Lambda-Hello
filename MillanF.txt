My name is Millan. 

3 words that describe me are: resilient, curious, independent.

My favorite hobby (at the moment) is drawing comics. Its something I used to love doing years ago, but when life happens and you don't have enough time for your craft, its easy to forget about it. Recently howver I acquired a drawing tablet and its done wonders for me. I can create once again, but in half the time. 
My comics are about interdimensional beings, intergalactic travel, but with political social justice overtones. Its pretty awesome, actually.

Hi my name is Anthony Stachowitz
I am a father. I've been dabling in programing for a while. I was never able to decide onwhich direction to go, hopefully this is the rightdirection. Finally. 

I like spending time with my daughter. As a first grader, It amazing to watch her dicover new things. 

I really like to be around people and just observe life, when I live in Las Vegas people watching was very interesting.

My name is Peggy Wollenhaupt. Three words that describe me are intelligent, introverted, and independent.

My passion in life is travel -- especially road trips. I have been to all of the continental 48 states, Canada, and Mexico. I've lived in ten different states, and rarely stay in one state for more than a couple of years. To make all this travel possible, I have worked remotely for almost my entire adult life.

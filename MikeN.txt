**My name is Mike Nichols.**

I am a husband, father, and coach.

One of my earliest memories is at maybe age 5, watching St. Louis Blues hockey games with my grandpa who died when I was a teenager.  I'm now 47, a lifelong ice hockey player and fan, and my team has a Stanley Cup. That mix of associations makes hockey my favorite hobby and comfort.  Can't wait to get it back.

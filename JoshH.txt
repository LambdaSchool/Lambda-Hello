My name is Josh Halvorson
Three words that could describe me are laidback, persistent, and quiet.
A favorite hobby of mine, like many 20 year olds who love tech, is gaming. The original playstation was my first console, im kind of young so i missed on the older
generation of consoles. Now I mainly play on my pc and really enjoy  games like the fallout series.

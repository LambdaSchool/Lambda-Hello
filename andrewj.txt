I am big in the tech world, I've always had a job in tech companies. Gamer, coder, Hunter.

I spend monst of my time in the week at work and I spend weekeneds gameing. Every part of me when I'm sitting at
a desk for too long wants to go outdoors and either fish or hunt. I like the otter because its adorable.

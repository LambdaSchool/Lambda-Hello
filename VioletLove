Hullo! My name is Violet and I am an AppleOS dev (in training)!

	 I am persistent, odd, and fun.

	 My favorite animal is the sloth.
It's fun to hang and do nothing. They're also super duper cute. 
It's legal to own one and so I have been looking into getting one.
That might well be the best day of my life!
Thanks for listening to me talk about sloths.

Hello, my name is Dan O'Neill.

3 words that describe me? Anxious, Thoughtful, Fortunate

My favorite animal is named Waldo. He is staring at me from the couch right now, wagging his dopey little tail. We just went for a walk/jog through the park during lunch. He is a 1+ year old Spaniel mix, we think. He looks very much like a 6-month-old Black Lab, but he is done growing. Please no one tell his cat-brother Theo that I chose to write this about Waldo rather than him.

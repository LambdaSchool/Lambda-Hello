Hi my name is Chris Hittlet.  Three words that describe me are nerdy, geeky(yes they are different things) and smart.

In my free time i like to spend time with my wife watching tv and going outside to enjoy beautiful oregon where we live.  We like to go hiking and kayak and many other out door activities.  We have two cute dauchshunds that light up our world.

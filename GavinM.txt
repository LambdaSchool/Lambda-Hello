Hi, my name is Gavin Murphy.

Three describing words:
1. Grit
2. Diligent
3. Relaxed

One of my favorite hobbies is reading.  A recent novel that I really enjoyed was A Gentleman In Moscow by Amor Towles.  My favorite animal is a dog.  As a kid, my family always had a toy poodle.  When I get a dog I want a Bulldog, or an Irish Setter, or both.

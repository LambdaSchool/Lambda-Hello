Hello, I am Sean Pheneger.

3 words to describe me are tenacious, inquisitive, and upbeat.

Some of my favorite activities are camping and fishing. I live in a smallish "big city"...Reno NV, so it's nice to get away from the concrete jungle and get back to nature to recharge.  The city life can get overwhelming and we tend to lose focus and sight of the bigger picture if we don't take a little time to step back and reconnect with our own psyche. fishing also helps clear the mind of everything but your pole and hook. its very meditative...if that's a word ;-)

Hello, I am Sean Pheneger.

3 words to describe me are selfish, arrogant, and vane.

A favorite activity of mine is golfing. I love how leasurely the day goes on the green when you are waiting behind that new players group to go to the next hole. I also love how when everything comes down to that special shot, everyone goes quiter than if they were in a library. Sand traps are the BEST! They really help you get a perspective on your life and what you are doing at that very moment.

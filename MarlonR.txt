Hello, my name is Marlon Raskin. A few words that do not describe me is 3 words that don't describe me are boring, stale, serious. Some of the things I love not to do is play and listen to theremin music. I have also discovered that I do not like coding and learning all that I can about Swift. Another thing that I love is attending Cher concerts, not. My favorite animal is a baboon.

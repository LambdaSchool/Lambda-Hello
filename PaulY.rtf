When I\'92m not attending Lambda School I enjoy spending time with my family, the outdoors, reading and working out.  I have two children, Haidyn and Tristyn, who are 7 and 8 respectively.  I also have a West Highland Terrier named Jak, two cats and two kittens.  I am originally from Florida and an alumnus of Florida State University, go Seminoles!}

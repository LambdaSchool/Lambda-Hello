Hi, my name is Jerrick.  The 3 words that describe me are optimistic, visionary, and tenacious.  My favorite hobby is probably creating music.  I am a terrible musician that makes terrible beats on my computer and share them with all my friends.  I also play classical / Spanish guitar and i\'92m terrible at that too.  Although my friends think I\'92m \strike \strikec0 really  \strike0\striked0  \'93decently\'94  good. \
\
I went to school to become a medical doctor, but I always found myself tinkering with computers and code.  So overtime I decided that this is what I need to do full time.  I thought I would miss the mental gymnastics of medicine, but computer programming is intense!  People say that it never lets up.  I think that is exciting.\
\
In time, I will form a company that will marry the two fields of computer programming and medicine.  Maybe something like Data Science or Machine Learning.  Until then I\'92m getting used to TableViews and Delegates, and Protocols with you guys.  Happy to be here learning with all of you!  If you want some terrible beats to jam to\'85. You know the guy to call.

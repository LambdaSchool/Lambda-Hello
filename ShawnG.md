Hello, my name is Shawn Gee. Three words that describe me (according to my wife) are persistant, loyal, and compassionate. I am living in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina right now, though my wife and I are looking to relocate when I go to find a job as an iOS Developer. We enjoy walking on the beach (which I just did during my lunch break), riding our electric skateboards, and exploring new places.

# Hello, I'm Leigh-Ann!

Three words that describe me:

* Curious
* Resourceful
* Creative

I studied theatrical set design in college and worked in event design prior to joining Lambda School. My current interests include rock climbing (I'm a newbie), cooking, and coding. I love climbing but I've been out of practice due to a shoulder injury - hopefully I can get back to it soon. I find it to be an excellent creative outlet. 

One extra tidbit: I think parrots rock.

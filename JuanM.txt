	I have many hobbys, but one that stands out for me will be Football(Soccer). I grew up knowing it as Football just like its known around the world, playing the sport as a little kid gave me freedom. It grew to a passion to play the game, watch it with my family. One good memory as little kid is being with my entire family waking up at 4am to watch Mexico play in the WorldCup in Korea, everyone glued to the TV. Fast forward to present day and I get to share and create more memories by attending our local MLS team LAFC.

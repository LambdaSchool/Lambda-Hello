Hello my name is Mary Sabol! 
Three words that describe me are Stubborn, Determined, and Goofy

One of my favorite hobbies is to play video games and I also really enjoy cooking new foods.
I have two basset hounds, one is 3 named Walnut and the other is Cashew and he is about 10 weeks old. 
My favorite animal is anything in the ocean really but I do really enjoy orcas and sharks! 
I really enjoy seafood, especially sushi! My favorite vegetable is broccoli. 
I also like to take my dog hiking, and I hope the puppy will enjoy hiking when he gets old enough. 

three words of a person unlike me would be quiet, extrovert, hyper

I do not participate in any sports and do not like to dance


Lidiia is the best PM!

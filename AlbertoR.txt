Hello, my name is Alberto Rodriguez.
Three words that describe me are, funny, self motivated and friendly.

My favorite things to do are being with my family, playing sports, and coding.
I love to spend time with my family and talking about life. We like to joke around but we can also have serious talks. Any chance I get to spend time with my family, I take advantage of it. I love to play sports. I play basketball and soccer. I love to watch football. Also I love to code and learning code. I enrolled into lambda with hopes of learning how to code much better and making a career out of it. Everything I do is for my family. I want to be successful in order to be able to provide for me and my family.

My family is everything to me and they are the reason I push my self so hard and the reason why I want to be successful in anything that I do. I want to make them proud and I want them to see me as an example that we can do whatever we set our mind to.

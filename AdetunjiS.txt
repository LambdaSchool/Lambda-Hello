Hello my name is Adetunji Shennaike and I am:

Logical
Spontaneous
Wanderer

My favorite thing to do since Highschool has been to dance. I honestly can't imagine a day that I am not dancing. 
It just happens so naturally that sometimes I don't even realize that I am doing it. 
I enjoy collaborating with others when I dance and teaching dance as well, since both things inspire me to grow more myself.

I do volunteer community neighborhood watch. I make sure all of the children are following the rules.
By the way I also set all of the rules for the neighborhood since I am the only one part of the watch. 
It will grow though... It will grow.

Hello, I'm Thomas Tuttle. Three words that discibe me are "predictable" "serious" "stickler"

 Some hobbies i enjoy are competitive rock skipping, spelling bee's and picking things up and putting them down again at a gym.

As far as rock skipping goes, i have won first place at the annual rock skipping tournement and tractor pull 8 years running. Those 12 year olds never stand a chance, but hey theres no age limit. 

 Spelling bees are just the best! 

 I love picking stuff up at the gym. i always do it while yelling, everyone looks and its just an awesome time 

 My favorite animal is the slug. Nothing better than an animal whos bodily fluids leave a trail and if stepped on you have to be scrubbed off with Go Be Gone.

 Some animals that get an honorable mention would be the Termites, Mosquitoes and Wasps. I know what you are thinking, this guy must be crazy.....well its an alternate reality.

 Y'all best be gettn' on outta heya, ya herd?

 "You get back here! you get back here and get offa my property!"

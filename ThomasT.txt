Hello, I'm Thomas Tuttle. Three words that discibe me are "curious" "rebelious" "persistent"

 Some hobbies i enjoy are collecting and listening to vynil records, kyaking and beta testing/error reporting a crypto/bittorrent based video platform.

As far as vynil, i love my punk rock and ska. 

 Kayaking in rivers, lakes and streams in the mountains during summer is very relaxing and i love to get away sometimes and just enjoy nature.

 The video platform i spend alot of time with has a small group of early investors. We talk about marketing strategy, product development and moderating social channels. We are currently beta testing a desktop app and the mobile versions for android and ios will be wrapped up this month. 

 My favorite animal is the turtle. Rather obvious, people call me Thomas Turtle instead of Tuttle quite often. So the turtle slowly grew on me. ha.....get it? slowly?

 Some animals that get an honorable mention would be the owls, poison dart frogs (specifically Oophaga pumilio) and a cuttlefish. I know what you are thinking, cuttlefish, yeah tuttle we get it. Actually while that is nice, i like them for the camoflauge abilities that are second to none. 

 i should probably wrap this up, eh?

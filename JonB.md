## About Me

- Musician
- Meditator
- Nerrrrrrrrd

I live in Bellingham, WA. I have a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Music Composition. Making music for a living is virtually impossible, so I've switched to software development; it's been a hobby for a few years, and I'm excited to make it my career.

I've been meditating off & on for about 6 years, really on for about 2 years (currently try to get in about an hour every day). I also still play music in various forms. I really like pizza.

That's probably enough for now?

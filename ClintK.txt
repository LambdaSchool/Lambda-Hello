Hi, I'm Clint Kunz. 
Three words that describe me are: father, husband, student. 
My two favorite hobbies are golf and reading. I like playing golf early in the morning when the temperature is cooler. And my favorite types of books are autobiographies.

Three words that don't decribe me are: extrovert, thief, surfer. 
One hobby that I do not participate in is knitting.

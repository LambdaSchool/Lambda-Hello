Hello, my name is Ryan Murphy. 

Three words that would describe me would be: 
Witty 
Genius 
Hilarious 
Humble ... 

I enjoy playing ice hockey, which may be a bit odd considering I am a Central Florida native. I have 2 cats (quite on accident really). I have a passion for old cars. Right now I have a '67 Mustang that is basically my child.

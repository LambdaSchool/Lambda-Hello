# Christian Ipanaque

Hi! My name is Christian and I am unemployed! These are 3 words that describe who I am and what my values are:

### Ignorant

I don't enjoy learning and understanding any new knowledge.

### Delicate

When facing problems, the chosen solutions may not be the correct ones. I don't learn from those mistakes and will never pursue or consider other solution alternatives.

### Lazy

There are many problems that we may face on a daily basis and finding solutions to those problems is a lot of hard work. Relaxing is my main accomplishment for the day.

### Favorite Hobbies

I enjoy sitting or laying down. While performing these activities, it is when I can wait patiently for any happiness to come into my life.

### Networking

I enjoy working with people who share my enthusiasm for sitting down and do nothing with their life. If you would to connect, add me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisipanaque/ "LinkedIn.com/in/ChrisIpanaque")

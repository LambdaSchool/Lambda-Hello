# Hi, I'm Bronson Mullens

## Three words that describe me
Patient, kind, and organized.

## My hobbies
I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends. I actually run a game and record it for a podcast. I enjoy writing as well. I published my first fantasy novel in 2019 and I am nearly finished with my second. Programming was another hobby of mine, but I'm trying to now turn it into a career.

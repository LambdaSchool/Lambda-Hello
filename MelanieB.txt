Hi My name is name is Melanie Barth.
Three words that describe me are loving, stubborn, and strong.
I have two favorite animals which are the dolphin and the sloth. I like
the dolphin because it is very intelligent and playful and swims in the ocean.
I love sloths because they are cute and playful and caring and carefree.

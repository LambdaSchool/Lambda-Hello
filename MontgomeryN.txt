Hello CS 13!
My name is Montgomery Nugen, but I go by Monty.
I really enjoy working with plants. I currently have a garden, but have poor soil, so things are not growing very well. Next year I plan to use hydroponics to grow my tomato plants and probably pepper plants. With luck I’ll get a much better harvest!

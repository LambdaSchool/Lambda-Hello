Hi, my name is John Moura

Three words that best describe me are: Creative, Inventive, Initiator

My favorite animal has always been an elephant. I chalk that up to the fact that my very first stuffed animal was a small red elephant.
My hobbies include cooking, cycling and pretty much anything outdoors.

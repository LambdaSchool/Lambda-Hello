My name is Jordy.
Open-minded

Relentless


	Honestly, other than my aptitude to learn how to code, I love to waste my time on League of Legends lol. I also spend some of my time in the home-brew community for several game systems, including the Nintendo Switch. I am simply a fanatic of games, and it is partly the cause for my interest in programming.

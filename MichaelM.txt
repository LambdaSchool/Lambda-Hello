Hello, my name is Michael. Three words to describe me are... introvert, lethargic, humorless. One of my favorite hobbies is ballroom dancing, I have been ballroom dancing ever since I can remember and have always really enjoyed it. I am currently dancing every weekend as well as teaching ballroom dance classes. Let me know if you want to learn how to ballroom dance...

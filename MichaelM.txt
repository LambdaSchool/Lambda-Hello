Hello, my name is Michael. Three words to describe me are... funny, witty, and easygoing. One of my favorite hobbies is video games, I have been gaming ever since I can remember and have always really enjoyed it. I am currently playing a lot of Fortnite on the computer but have played a vast variety of games all the way from mobile/console games, to very a variety of PC games. Let me know if you want to get bodied in Fortnite...

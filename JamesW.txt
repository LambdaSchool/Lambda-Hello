My name is James Wigdor. Three words to describe me are Passionate, Empathetic, and Friendly. I've played guitar since i was 15 years old and was a lead guitarist in a touring band around New York. I consider music to be the art of language that you can't fully put into words, but can connect perfectly with feelings.

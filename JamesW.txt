Hi, My name is James Tucker Wray. I would introduce myself by my middle name, Tucker, if we met on the street.
Three words that describe me are honesty, empathy, and hardwork. I learned early on in life that the truth will set you free. 
Even in hard situations, its easier to get whatever it is said and out in the air so the wounds can begin to heal. Also alot of times,
its not nearly as bad as we make things out to be in our own minds. In the early days of my public education one of our teachers
taught us about the golden rule and that has stuck with me ever since. I wonder how people are feeling and try to figure them out.
I think alot of this empathy comes from times in my schoolyears that i felt shy, timid or uneasy about social situations and i think
 its important to help people feel okay about life in general. Its too short to be worried all the time. Finally My grandmother
instilled a hardwork attitude in me at a young age also. She had me out in the fields tending her flower and vegetable gardens; workin
the land. After it was all done she praised me and cooked me dinner.  Carrying these three traits into my adult life
I have picked up hobbies along the way; one I still maintain is auto mechanics. I have a Jeep that  I love to tinker with and work on. 
Alot of times i will scour the internet looking for a way to upgrade my gas mileage or solve a shimmy in the steering and find forums
 that yield how others have approached and solved these problems in the past. I plan a trip to the pull a part and 'rescue' a suitable 
 part from a broken down jeep of a similiar model to install as an upgrade on mine. Getting to the end of a difficult project is extremely
satisfying and rewarding. You save money working on it yourself and theres a sense of accomplishment that really does good for a persons selfworth. 
I get alot of this same feeling  of satsfaction working in web development. I look forward to making and conquering new goals in the tech field.

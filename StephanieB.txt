My name is Stephanie B. Three words that describe me are funny, thoughtful, and sentimental. 
My favorite thing to do is to spend time with my family and friends. I enjoy listening to music and playing video games.My favorite animal is obviously a puppy! Who doesnâ€™t love puppies? My favorite color is pink and mozzarella sticks are my favorite food.

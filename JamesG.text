Hey, Jake! It's me, Jamie Goodnight. Technically James Edgar Goodnight III. 

Three words that describe me; sardonic, thoughtful, and uncertain.

My favorite hobby isss... not really sure! Surfing the web and arguing with people on Reddit anonymously. 
It's hard to pick one favorite. I like silkie chickens, fancy goldfish (oranda, ranchu, pearlscale), cats, turtles, and praying mantids.

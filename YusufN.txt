Hello my name is Yusuf Nafey.

Here are three words that describe me:
	1. thoughtful
	2. friendly
	3. attentive

I don't have one specific favorite hobby,
but I love going outdoors in general. Whether
it's biking, swimming, hiking, or anything 
along those lines, I'm a fan. I also love 
watching basketball and am a huge fan of the 
Lakers. My favorite animal is a tiger. If I 
could have a tiger as a pet I probably would, 
but since I can't I have to bengal cats. :)

Hello Lambda, my name is Kobe McKee.

I am:
Athletic
Driven
Stubborn

My favorite hobby is really a group of hobbies. I enjoy anything that can get me outside and/or keep me active. I've been fishing all my life and within the last couple years got into fly fishing. I've also play sports all my life. I'm always happy to throw a baseball around or go shoot hoops.
My favorite animal is my dog, Chewie. He's a Maltese-Yorkie mix. He's got that Yorkie fire in him and can be annoying when someone is at the door but he's soft and fluffy which makes up for it.

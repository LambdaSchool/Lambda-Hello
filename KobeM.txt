Hello Lambda, my name is Kobe McKee.

I am:
Loud
Annoying
Intrusive

I spend my free time singing, I'm very good and write my own lyrics.
My favorite animal is my dog, Chewie. He's a Maltese-Yorkie mix. He's got that Yorkie fire in him and can be annoying when someone is at the door but he's soft and fluffy which makes up for it.

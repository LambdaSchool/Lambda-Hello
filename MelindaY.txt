My name is Melinda but I go prefer Mindy.

Eccentric
Goofy
Shy

I knit and crochet a lot so that I can relax and stop thinking. 
I mean I'm thinking but mostly its counting stitches. 
I've become a yarn snob and a yarn horder because of this.
However, I love creating beautiful blankets etc and giving them away.

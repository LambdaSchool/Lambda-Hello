Hello Everyone!

My name is Gicard Boulou, but I go by Francois. It's my middle name and I think it's slightly easier for people to say than Giscard. Yes, the name is French! No, I'm not from France. I'm from Chile! Came to the US when I was 10.
Words that describe me...let's see...
Indecisive.
Bipedal.
Hungry.

That last one only applies at certain times. Like right now.
I drink way too much CoZero. I like rock climbing and Muay Thai. I have a candy red children's electric guitar (I call it my guitart) that I play every few months. I'm trying to get gud at Splatoon 2. Hit me up if you wanna start a team!

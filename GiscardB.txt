Hello Everyone!

My name is Gicard Boulou. It's hard for non-French speakers to say but after 28 years of life I'm still not tired of having to teach people to say it. I look forward to it every day! Yes, I am from France! No, I'm not from Chile! Where did you get that crazy idea?
Words that describe me.
Decisive
Quadripedal
Blood-thirsty.

That last applies at all times and in all situations. Like right now...
I only drink the tears of my enemies. Recently I switched to diet tears because the sodium was causing some health problems. I enjoy nothing. Except revenge.
I'm trying to get gud at Splatoon 2. Hit me up if you wanna start a team!

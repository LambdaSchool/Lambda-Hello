My favorite daily hobby is probably playing video games. The main game I stick to is called

only go every once in a while. My favorite animal is a tiger. I currently work part time at 
Place called craft axe throwing where I teach people to throw axes then monitor then while they
throw. Its a fun job and a great work enviornment.

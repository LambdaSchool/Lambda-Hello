My name is LaDonna Mayfield.

Three words that would describe me are determined, chill, and self-motivated.

My favorite things to do are hiking, study architecture and sustainable design, trencadis mosaics, walking, biking and eating sweets.

I am obsessed with penguins, especially Emperor and African penguins. They seem so wise and caring.

Hello!

My name is Jess Harrison. 

Three Words that Describe Me: 

1. Perfectionist
2. Shy
3. Determined (nice way to say stubborn)

I have several hobbies. I learned to knit about 12 years ago and have spent an ungodly amount of money on yarn since then. I love complicated lace knitting. My favorite animal is an otter. My favorite childhood memories are spending time at the zoo with my mom and my favorite thing to do was sit by the otter exhibit and watch them play. I have a 2 yr old rescue mutt named Nova who is the best dog in the entire world.

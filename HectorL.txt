Hello! My name is Hector Ledesma. Three words that describe me are: Disciplined, Resourceful and Autodidactic. I have a couple of hobbies that I feel passionate about, Guitar and Korean. But if commitment is the measurement of favoritism, then weightlifting would be my favorite hobby. Looking good makes you feel good :). I really enjoy playing video games. MMORPGs, but since they take so much commitment I've forced myself to not touch them :(. If you're into Black Desert, Vindictus, Archeage or Blade and Soul please tell me about it so I can live vicariously through your adventures.

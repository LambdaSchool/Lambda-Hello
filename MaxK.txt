Hey there, I'm Max.

Three words that describe me:

Spontaneous
Compulsive
Outgoing

  Veganism is about living a healthy and ethical lifestyle. All sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. We ought to take a stand against exploitation and cruelty of animals. The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment and our conscience.

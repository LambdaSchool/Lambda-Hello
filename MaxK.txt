Hey there, I'm Max.

Three words that describe me:

Curious
Analytical
Obsessive

  I'm just a dorky, half-asian guy from Hawaii. I grew up on the internet. I used to spend an ungodly amount of time playing online games like World of Warcraft, Path of Exile, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Overwatch. Nowadays I do a lot of reading and learning about interesting subjects like autonomous and electric vehicles, reusable spacecraft, internet technology, and cryptocurrencies.

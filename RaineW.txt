Hello, all at Lambda, my name is Raine Wallace <3

I'm supposed to write about a hobby or a passion that's impostant to me, so I'm going to tell you guys about the La Grange Ghost Tours.

This probably isn't the best thing to talk about in a computer-science course, but I think it's interesting and I love doing it.

Myself and other guides lead candlelit tours around La Grange, KY and talk about all the supernatural stuff that happens in all the buildings (literally, all of the buildings) on Main Street. Even if you don't believe in that sort of thing, it's still fun to go inside some of the creepier parts of shops and hear about our strange history!

If you didn't already think I was a nerd, this probably confirmed it. That being said, we're all taking this class, so do any of us really have room to talk?

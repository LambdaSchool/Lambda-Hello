Tyler Christian

how i would describe myself

Long majestic hair 
Headstrong
always happy to help others








My main hobby is mini wargaming i am a very big fan of both the warhammer40k and fantasy universes. The main thing i love about the game/books is the sheer amount of
story and lore that gose into it so many diffrent worlds and armies with diffrent ways of doing things but also fighting for the same goals is just amazing to me 
and seeing this great epic of a grim dark future where there are no good guys only shades of greay really makes it hard to pick a single most favorite faction 
i have switched favorites more times then i can count but in my top 3 are the orks,tyranids,and the world eaters.

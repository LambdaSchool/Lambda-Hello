My name is Tyler Clawson.
Three words to describe me: Tenacious, Witty, Intense
Hobby: My biggest hobby is music. I play piano, guitar, and bass. My favorite genre of music is Jazz, but you can find good music in any genre. I have been playing for about a decade, and I'm always hungry to hear new and innovative music... and I enjoy long walks on the beach.

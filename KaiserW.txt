Hello, my name is Kaiser Wu!

Three words to describe me would be fit, extroverted, slow.

I absolutely love playing bocce. Nothing brings me greater joy than the act of rolling a ball into another ball to see if I can get my ball closer to a smaller ball than my opponent. I know the basic rules of bocce and all the ins and outs and I play it all the time in my bocce club. Not a day goes by when I don't play bocce.

Hello, my name is Kaiser Wu!

Three words to describe me would be sharp, lazy, curious.

My favorite hobby is playing video games or tabletop RPGs. I love playing the games, obviously, but I also really enjoy looking into the stats in the game and reading about interesting ways to combine abilities or build different characters to make something unique or exciting or gamebreaking. I think seeing a well-balanced game is always impressive considering all the crazy ways players try to bend or break the rules to make things go crazy.

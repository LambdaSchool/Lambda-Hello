Hey there! My name is Amarachi Ejiawoko.

God-fearing, aesthetic, and passionate.

My absolute favorite hobby is dance. I'm an Afrobeats dancer, and have been dancing, choreographing, and performing since I was eight years old. If you aren't familiar with Afrobeats, think Nigerian or West African pop and hip-hop music. I'm Nigerian, so being able to connect to my culture through dance has been a gift that I've always cherished and loved sharing. This past year, I experienced a lot of cool opportunities with dance. I became an Afrobeats dance instructor, danced in a music video shot here in the Bay Area, and I was a dancer/actor/singer/musician in an Afro-Urban Musical: Bakanal de Afrique. All these events were huge highlights in my life, and I will carry them with me forever. Hopefully, other opportunities will arise in the future, even after I become a BOMB software engineer/programmer.

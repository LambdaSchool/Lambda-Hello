Hello my name is Jack and three words that describe myself are spiritual, respectful, 
and kind.  Some of my favorite things to do is find a spot in nature and just breathe.  
I like to listen to nature, listen to the water, hear and feel the wind blowing. 
I love all of God's creations but my favorite animal is a cow. Then take a walk on the beach.

Hi, my name is Christopher DeVito

Three words that describe me are: Christian, Father, Honest

I have little time for hobbies these days. I have 50/50 custody of my 4 year old son, and spend as much time as I can with him on the days I have him. On the other days, I work as much as I can so that I have that time to spend with my son on the days I have him. In my infrequent free time, I like to read (often Sci-Fi, but also books on leadership, science, and entrepreneurship). I also enjoy playing video games, such as No Man's Sky and World of Warcraft. My son and I have recently started playing Pokemon Go, which has been a fun way to spend occasional afternoons walking around downtown St. Pete. 

Recently, I have also been spending as much time as I can learning to code. I am currently studying iOS development at Lambda School and looking forward to an awesome year. I hope to go on to become a mobile app developer in the near future.

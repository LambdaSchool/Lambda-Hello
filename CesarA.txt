Hello, my name is Cesar. 

Three words to discribe me: Hyper, High-Fiver, Dabber

My favorite "hobbie" is really anything to do with tech. Since I was 5, I've known I wanted to be part of the tech industry in one way or another. 
My favorite food is Lasagna, favorite animal is any reptile (can't pick just one), and I love long walks on the beach under the sun rise as I trip and face plant.

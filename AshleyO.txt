Hi, my name is Ashley O.

Three words that discribe me are:
1. Determined
2. Amiable 
3. Driven

I really love art. Since I was quite young, I have had an interest in drawing. 
That interest grew to include other forms of art such as photogreaph,
imaging, and other forms of digital art. Other than art, I have a puppy named
Ila that I adore. Even though I am more of an inside person, I love
to take her outside to play.

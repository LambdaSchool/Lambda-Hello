Hello!

My name is Guillermo Arria-Devoe. Three words that describe me are thinking, dreaming, creating. My favorite hobby is now web development but I enjoy horticulture just as much, my favorite animal is the dog, and my goal in life is to create an off-grid community of intellectuals, horticulturists, and creatives.

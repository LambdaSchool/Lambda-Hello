Hello Lambda, 

My name is Nate. The three words I'd use to describe myself are: passionate, motivated, curious. 

My favorite hobbies would be watching films and documentaries. I'm also a huge fan of the NBA and my hometown team the Golden State Warriors. Though I sold mine recently, I also love riding motorcycles.

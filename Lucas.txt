Hi, i'm Lucas from Brazil.

Three words that describe me: quiet, kind and fair.

I like to play online games and spend time with my wife and friends.
My favorite animals are dogs and lions.

Entering this new world and trying to learn everything i can with this amazing Lambda community.
Thank you all for using your time to make videos and tutorials for us, i really appreciate it!

See ya! :B

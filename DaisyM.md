#Lambda-Hello Challenge

##My name is Daisy Mesa.

Three words to describe me are: curious, driven, and dependable.

I enjoy traveling, trying new foods and restaurants, watching soccer, and binging on Netflix series (even though I barely have the time for it!).

My favorite animals are dogs - I'd love to have a dog now, but my apartment is too small.  Although dogs are my favorite, I do appreciate cats as well!  I adopted a cat with an old roommate of mine, and decided to name him Henry, because it sounded very much like a "person" name.  Since my name is Daisy, when I meet someone new, I VERY frequently get "Oh my gosh, that's my dog's name!!" and am never sure how to react.  So, hopefully no one named Henry will be offended when I tell them that was my cat's name!

Hello, my name is Kseniya.

Three words that describe me are active, determined and stubborn.

I love giraffes. Did you know that giraffes have seven cervical vertebrae in their neck, just like we do. Awsome, right!?
My favorite hobbie is wakeboarding. This is like snowboaring, but only on water. I live in Florida, so I spend all year long on the lake doing wakeboard. I even got the board with image of giraffe on it. I'm lying, I have a penguin :).

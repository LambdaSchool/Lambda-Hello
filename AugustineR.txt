Hi my name is Sam Rodriguez. Three words to describe me would be
fun, shy, and happy. my favorite animal is the extinct masiakasaurus.
although I like all dinosaurs I pick that specific one because unlike its
scary cousins it only ate fish, and had teeth that poked forward so it can 
catch fish better.

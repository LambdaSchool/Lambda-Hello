My name is Noah. Just Noah. If you�re reading this, then I commend your commitment. I will strive to reward your dedication with as many words as I can. I am a brother to my sister first and foremost, a bibliophile next, and a student always. My business card says Technical Recruiter, but if you read between the lines, it will also mention some marketing duties, some database integrity headscratching, and a liberal sprinkling of ping pong. I enjoy chasing la volupte, finding le mot juste, and using foreign phrases like I actually know what they mean. And while we�re at it, disproportionately sized objects, epilogues, magnets, alliteration, and things that spin. As for my future, I plan on being a pioneer. Because if you never do anything that nobody�s done, then you�ll only be better than nobody.

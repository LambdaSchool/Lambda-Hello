Hello my name is Sem Limi
My favorite hobbies include long distance running, cooking, crossfit, obstacle racing, pop-up card making and many other creative endeavors.

My favorite animal is snakes even though they scare the living daylights out of me. But I love looking at how scary and creepy they are as long as 
I'm in a safe distance away from them.

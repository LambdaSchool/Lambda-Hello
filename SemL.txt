Hello my name is Sem Limi
My favorite hobbies include long distance running, cooking, crossfit, obstacle racing, pop-up card making and many other creative endeavors.

My favorite animal is snakes even though they scare the living daylights out of me. But I love looking at how scary and creepy they are as long as 
I'm in a safe distance away from them.

 Someone completely unlike me would be someone who is very logical and stiff, someone very outgoing and aggressive. 
 Hobbies I've never done before have been playing the violin.
 An alternate reality version of me, would be someone who travels a lot.

My name is Brandon Lee Vilaychith.

I would describe myself as a hard worker, fast learner, and friendly.

My favorite hobby of mine would be learning about cars and working on them. I haven't 
been into cars that long only the past 4 years. I've learned a lot about them and 
how to fix and install some things. I've installed brakes, rotors, intakes, exhaust pipes.
One day I'll own my dream car, the Honda Civic Type R, and I want to go drifting on a 
track one day and build my own "race car". I'm not really into American cars, I prefer 
Japanese and European cars the most.

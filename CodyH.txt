Hello! 

My name is Cody, Harmon. Three words that describe me are mean, lazy, messy.  
  
My favorite hobby is sky diving. Being up high, seeing the ground coming at  
me in fast, seemingly insane speeds, is just the best! I can't wait to go  
at least three times a week for the rest of my life.

Edit 1: I am a Dragon!

Edit for commit ammend: I wish I was a dragon. I am just a friendly, dedicated, intuitive guy who   
plays the guitar, and makes friends wherever he can, while always continuing  
to learn every chance he gets.

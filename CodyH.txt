Hello! 

My name is Cody, Harmon. Three words that describe me are funny, driven, kind.  
  
My favorite hobby is maybe a tie between playing the guitar/singing, and gaming.  
The reason I can't really choose probably is encapsulated in the fact that I tend  
to do both when I'm stressed, and when I'm happy. They help me get back to zen and  
keep getting back to success at whatever I was stuck on.

Hi, I'm Josh.

Three words that describe me:
- Geek
- Gamer
- Outgoing

My favorite hobby is gaming, because no matter whether I am in the mood for a simple escape or looking for something to satisfy my crave for competition 
there is a game that suits me. Dogs have always been my favorite type of animal because I have always had a dog as a pet, and I find them to be both loyal 
and loving.

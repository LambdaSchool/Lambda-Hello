I know we all have a story of whoa. But I'm so sick of mine I don't know what to do. But once I've made my mind up its rare that I sway from my hard-headed mentality. Just saying I have made my mind up that some how some way Lambda will be the place I learn how to be a WORKING bad ass developer. If I can only get git down... see you at Facebook HQ!

Hello! My name is Ben Quackenbush.

Three word: Happy introverted extrovert. 

My favorite animals are the sphynx cat. They are fantastic little creatures, and I currently am the proud father of two of them. Their names are Eros and Psyche from the greek mythology. They are a hairless breed of cat, and for me, they are perfect as I have some cat allergys. If anyone would like to see them, hit me up in Slack!

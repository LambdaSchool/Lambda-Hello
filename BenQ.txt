Hello! My name is Ben Quackenbush.

Three word: Depressed extroverted introvert. 

My least favorite animals are the sphynx cat. They are selfish little creatures, and I currently am the sad father of two of them. Their names are Eros and Psyche from the greek mythology. They are a hairless breed of cat, and for me, they are the worst as I have some cat allergys.

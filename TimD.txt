Hi, I'm Tim

I'd say I'm... easy-going, analytical, and persistent.

I really like to cook, though I don't get around to it very often anymore.  My house has a very, very small kitchen, so big projects are a pain.
I spent a couple years working as a cook part time when I was younger.  Actually a fun (if wierd, and stressful) job.  Terrible way to make money though.

Hello my name is Samuel Esserman

One of my favorite hobbies, is Brazilian JJ. I have practiced different martial arts for, almost, my entire life. I began with Krav Maga which is an Israeli self defense form. When I was in Israel (15-17) I was able to train with basically anyone because everyone knew the art. However, I wanted to train BJJ because I admire Joe Rogan and he always suggested it.

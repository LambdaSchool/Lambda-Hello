# Lambda Hello

## Git && GitHub Project

### Name

Hello, everyone! My name is Ryan Boris.

### Three Words

Three words that describe me are erratic, pessimistic, and nonlinear.

### Not Favorites

I do not care for learning new things or the process of education as a whole, especially anything involving cooking or molecular gastronomy.  You will never find me making anything savory or deserts and I couldn't even tell you how to turn on the microwave, let alone how to operate the stove or oven.  I am not patient and would not do well with the step-wise approach that is often used in the kitchen, especially with desserts.

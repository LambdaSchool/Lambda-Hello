My name is Aislynn Edmiston. Three words that discribe me are creative, friendly, and outdoorsy. 

I have a few favorite hobbies, I keep fish and have a betta named Zy, 
a tiger oscar named Espi, and a peacock eel named snoopy. I also like flowers and plants so 
next to my desk I have an inside garden, with 2 orchids, a jade plant and a golum jade, aloe, a flowering succulant
and some basil.

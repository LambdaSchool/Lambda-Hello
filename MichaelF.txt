Hey! I'm Michael. 

Passionate, Energetic, and Observant

I'm a huge fan of playing guitar. I mainly play acoustic on my Taylor SG Mini, but I also have an awesome Gibson Les Paul if I'm feeling like playing some electric. I started playing because of my dad when I was younger, and have really loved taking breaks from coding by sitting down and playing some music. It's a great way to relax, and also to build my resistance to becoming frustrated while learning, because playing guitar is not easy!

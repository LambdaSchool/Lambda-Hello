Hello, my name is Modesto Tamayo.

Three words that describe me would be Anime, Food and Games.

My favorite hobby is Anime watching/playing video games. I can't say i enjoy one more than the other. 
Watching anime is a very relaxing activity while also being able to get invested into the characters and the world created. 
While gaming speaks to my competitive nature and the want to always improve myself.

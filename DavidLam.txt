Three words that best describe me:

 - Balanced
 - Patient
 - Confident

I am a professional whale feeder. I feed the biggest Blue Whales in the Pacific Ocean. Every time they see me, I can see the joy in their eyes.

P/S: One time, a whale was so happy with the food I brought her, she licks my face.

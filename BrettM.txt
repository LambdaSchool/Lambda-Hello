My name is Brett Madrid.

I am: Motivated, thoughtful, and steadfast.

I have currently have three favorite activities.  I workout at the gym 5 days a week to keep myself physically healthy and attractive. I am also a musician and play guitar and bass to help me express myself emotionally and spiritually.  My last passion is chess - I study every morning for an hour over my morning coffee.  Chess keeps my  mind sharp and fluid and open to creative thinking, as well as keeping me humble (there's always someone better!).

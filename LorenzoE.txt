Analytical, Nocturnal,Eccentric

My favorite hobby is probably listening to music, depending on my mood, and the weather. I'm particularly fond of Lupe Fiasco, The Antlers, and Kids See Ghosts at the moment.

My favorite animal is definitely Bengal tigers.

I also find trading and investing to be extremely interesting, especially in the context of Black Swan Theory.

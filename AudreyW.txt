## AUDREY WELCH

Hello, my name is Audrey Welch. I am an optimistic person who is adventurous and empathetic.

My favorite hobby is drinking natural wine with other people that love it. The reason it is so fun is because natural wine expresses the terroir of the grapes due to the winemaker refraining from adding or subtracting anything during the process. It's wine that uses wild yeasts, is hand harvested, often not filtered, and respectful of the earth. And of course, delicious and very chill.

My favorite thing to do in the world is writing music. I’ve been writing music since I was 8 years old. Music has kept me going and has been there for me when others were not. I might have Dreds but don’t ask me if I like reggae. Of course I like reggae. Everyone likes reggae. Who doesn’t like reggae? If you don’t like reggae something is wrong with you.

# Introduce yourself by name. 
My name is Oliver A. 
# List three words that describe you. 
I can be described by the words smart, funny and handsome (depending on who you ask). 
# Write a few sentences or a paragraph about your favorite hobby, your favorite animal, or another personal favorite suitable for sharing on a public site.
My favorite hobby is reading articles online. I mostly read articles related to consumer technology, but I find that I can read reviews, speculation and analysis nearly endlessly. Utilizing a news aggregator application, I’m able to make quick work of multiple news and opinion sources in one window; I don’t know why I find so much pleasure from staying up to date on trends and rumors!

Hi! My name is Erica Chen and three words I would use to describe myself would be adventurous, creative, and energetic. Edit: outgoing, scientific, stern  

Some of my hobbies include cooking, baking, and drawing pictures of food (really. I just love food that much) Outside of the kitchen, I enjoy practicing piano and flute, taking long walks, and pretending I know how to garden. My favorite cookie is definitely the classic chocolate chip. 
Edit: Doing laundry and dishes every day!

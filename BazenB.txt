Hi, my name is Bazen. 
Three words that describe me are: Nerdy, goofy, athletic. 


My favorite hobby is probably watching movies, writing and learning about interesting stories about history. 
Alt Reality: Seeing people sad and angry extends my life by 36 minutes or so it feels. 


My favorite animal is a Tiger because lions are so popular. Another personal favorite of mine is being in nature and exploring.

Someone completely unlike me? Stiff, Mean, Bored.

Hi!

My name is Jack Seymour. The 3 words I most want to embody are: clever, parsimonious and feared. The 3 words I most likely embody are tired, verbose and good natured. I have a 2 year old son, his name is Kieran and he's about to turn 3 on the 23rd of September -- he's pretty much perfect and has my mom's pale blue eyes. I used to work as a cook and one of my favorite things to do to this day is cook, the act of choosing ingredients by hand, chopping and preparing and actually applying heat is wonderful and if you make something yummy, other people tend to like having you around. Plus you get to eat! 

Hope I get to meet you all one on one and we can become friends, or at least profitable acquaintences!

Hi!

My name is Jack Seymour. I am a formless entity that exists only at the intersection of of the shadows of two buildings downtown on particularly sunny days. I thirst for spilled blue rasberry Icees.

Hope I get to meet you all one on one and we can become friends, or at least profitable acquaintences!

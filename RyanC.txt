Hello everyone, my name is Ryan.

Three words to describe me are:
1. creative 
2. broke 
3. misfit

My favorite hobby is filmmaking. You can see my work at theryanclausen.com. My website is in desperate need of a redesign. I will take that problem on some time in the coming months, time permitting. My most recent film, I Thought You'd Be Gone, played in Seattle last month and is still in consideration at a few other film festivals. My previous work has been screened at film festivals across the country, winning a few awards along the way. The most prestigious is my Audience Choice award at the National Film Festival for Talented Youth.

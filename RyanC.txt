Hello everyone, my name is not Ryan.

Three words to describe me are:
1. invisible
2. intangible
3. nonexistent

As a complete non-being, I am incapable of having hobbies. Though my friends, if it were capable for another person to befriend a non-being, would say I enjoy floating around nowhere doing nothing. But to reiterate, a non-being like myself can't have hobbies. However, all of this does beg the question, if there is no 'me,' who wrote this?

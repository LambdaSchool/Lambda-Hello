My name is Mark and I am friendly, spontaneous and social. 

My favourite animal is cow and it is much more beneficial than other animals. 
It gives us milk which is a nutritious protein supply for us. It provides us meat and the leather equipments are made from its skin. In some countries, the cow is used for plowing the land and for faming purposes.

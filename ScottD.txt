Hello everyone.  I am Scott Dee, I live in Herriman, UT.
3 words that describe me:  Dedicated, Sensitive, Caring.
I'm married with 4 awesome children.  I love camping in the mountains of Utah.  I love 4-wheeling all over the hills seeing everything there is to see.  I have a wonderful dog named Maggie who is a Catahoula-Leapord/German Sheperd mix.  She also loves camping with us.

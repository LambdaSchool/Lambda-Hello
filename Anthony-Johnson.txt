Hello my name is Anthony J. Johnson


Three words that best describe me.

#Hustle #Learn #Ambitious


What I love to do most is share time with my family.
I work a lot before coming to lambda as a audio engineer, although 
I love what  I do i was freelance and the only way to make ends meet was to stay busy.
Since Lambda decided to take a chance on me i'm throwing everything I have into become a better developer.
I WILL NOT LOSE..........

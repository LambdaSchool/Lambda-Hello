Name: Kendra Williams
Three words: hype, talkative, combative

I love writing about me it makes me feel special. My favorite hobbies are talking on the phone, camping, and bird watching.  I have three cats name binky, winky, and blinky. They like to meow at the sun at 5am like roosters.

Edit: all of these are lies muhahahaha.

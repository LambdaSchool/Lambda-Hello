Name: Kendra Williams
Three words: sarcasm, smart, lazy

I really dislike writing "about me" information. I feel like I'm just a weirdo who like inappropriate things like reading about serial killers or watching snapped.  I do have two cute little dogs who are also monsters, but that’s about it. They’re both three; however, the yorkie is 2.5lbs and has little dog syndrome.  The Maltese, on the other hand, is super chill and likes to watch TV with me.

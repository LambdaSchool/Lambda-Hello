My name is Austin Esparza.
Three words that describe me are intellectual, adventurous, and sexy-beyond-belief.
My favorite hobby would be to snowboard but am able to very rarely do so in SoCal. My favorite animal by far is a dog. I have a Boston Terrier and I fell in love with his crazy looking terrier eyes immediately.

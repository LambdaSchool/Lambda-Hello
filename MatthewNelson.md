* Description in three words

* Favorite Hobbies

	Building things and solving problems.

	I enjoy home renovation stuff (gutting to finishing, electrical
	work, fine wood working, bathrooms, kitchen remodels, landscaping,
	etc.). I also enjoy building computers, networking, security/privacy
	solutions.
	
	Educational content is always on my to do list. I enjoy reading
	anything from science fiction to technical manuals.
	
	These past 6 months, though, I have been enjoying the best hobby
	of them	all; fatherhood! Playing with my son and helping him learn/grow
	has been the best hobby that I have found yet. It never gets old.

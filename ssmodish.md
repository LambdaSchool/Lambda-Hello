I was a fan of, and had dabbled in, computer animation before "[Toy Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3986gGp3Qs)" came out. Around the year 2000, I found out that the college I was going to had a class to learn [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) and animation. While learning that, I went to some [SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) meetings, and in 2001, the conference in New Orleans. Although I got the flu while I was there, it was very impressive and I've been going to meetings at my local chapter ever since. Eventually, they adopted me and made me their "webmaster".

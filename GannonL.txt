My name is Gannon L. 

I'm described as funny, easy-going, and often too calm considering the odd situtations I find myself in. 

My hobby is video games, I'm hooked on civ 6 as of this writing.
My fav animal is german shepard and I cannot wait to adopt one some day. 
My other fav is my addiction to tea... you will rarely see me without a cup on my hand.

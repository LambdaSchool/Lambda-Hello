My name is Craig

I am inquisitive, accepting, and loyal.

I'm a dad to two daughters and an English bulldog. They are all really great. We live in Minnesota, southwest of Minneapolis. I like golfing in pleasant weather and staying indoors in less-than-pleasant weather.

This ammendment is for the extra credit question.

I love ultimate, sometimes known as ultimate Frisbee (but Frisbee is actually a brand name). I think I'll go play it tonight! If you're not familiar with it, it's a team sport on a rectangular field with endzones. You can't move while you have the disc, so you have to get the disc around the field by throwing it between teammates. If a pass is unsuccessful (out of bounds, dropped, blocked, or intercepted), the other team gets a turn with the disc.

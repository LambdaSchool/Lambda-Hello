My name is Eva. I’m from Siberia, Russia and I moved to the US a year and half ago. 

I love traveling a lot. I try to travel as much as possible. One of my favorite countries to visit is Turkey. 

One of my friends was born and grown up in Lyon, France and we have totally different personalities.  Because his job includes too many business trips, he doesn’t like to travel at all.

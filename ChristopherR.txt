Hello_World my name is Christopher Roth. If I had to describe myself in three words I would have to say "Curious, Funny and Extroverted." 
I Have so much time for activities and hobbies like reading trashy tabloids and watching Oprah while talking on the phone to 3 of my closest guy friends.
If I had to have a least favorite animal I would have to say it's my dog Obi. He is a mutt that I got from the shelter when he was barley 4 months old.
Hes now almost 2 and He is 78 lbs of solid LOVE. 

I really like Lambda School and I'm excited to GIT the knowledge they are giving me. (see what I did there? git it.... git jokes)

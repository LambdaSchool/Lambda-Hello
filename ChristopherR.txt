Hello_World my name is Christopher Roth. If I had to describe myself in three words I would have to say "Curious, Funny and Extroverted." 
Before starting this cohort I HAD hobbies that included Disc-golf, Cooking, Rock climbing and hanging out at the nearest body of water.
If I had to have a favorite animal I would have to say it's my dog Obi. He I a mutt that I got from the shelter when he was barley 4 months old.
Hes now almost 2 and He is 78 lbs of solid LOVE. 

I really like Lambda School and I'm excited to GIT the knowledge they are giving me. (see what I did there? git it.... git jokes)

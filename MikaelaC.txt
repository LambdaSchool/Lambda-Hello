Hi there! My name is Mikaela Currier. 
Three words that describe me: ambitious, curious, and passionate.
My favorite hobby is rock climbing. While I haven't tried rock climbing outdoors (yet!), I have a lot of fun pushing myself to get better on the routes at my local rock climbing gym.
I started this hobby in February of this year and have already seen a lot of progress. Even when I don't feel like I'm doing great, I still have fun getting out there, meeting new people, 
and honing in my skills. My favorite thing about rock climbing is that its a workout, but it doesn't feel like it. I'm using my muscles, but that's secondary to having fun.

Hello, I'm Chad Parker. I am curious, adventurous, and perfectionist.

I love music, many kinds, but most of it has some kind of electronic-based sound. But I also love seeing and hearing a masterful performance from a solo analog instrument.

Also, my kids. I wouldn't have said I was ready for kids before, but they have brought much love and fun to my life.

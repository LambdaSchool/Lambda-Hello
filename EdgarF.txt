Hello I'm Edgar. Spontaneous. Sarcastic. Multipurpose.
My favorite hobby is playing video games. I've been a gamer I got my hands on a GameBoy that I remember took my parents eons to get for me. This only happened after I begged and actually after they originally bought what they thought would trick me into thinking it was a GameBoy. But I was no fool. My favorite animals are my five dogs and my one cat. They are a little pet gang. Don't mess with them.

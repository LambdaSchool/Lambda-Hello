Hi! My name is Ryan.

Three words that describe me are hilarious, hungry, and tired.

In my free time (which is mythical and rarely exists), I envision myself binge watching everything on Netflix, making lots of weird crafty things with my hands, art journaling, and just spending time with good people, going with the flow.

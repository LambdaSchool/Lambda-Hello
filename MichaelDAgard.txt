My name is Michael Agard. I'm 31 years old and love to travel.

The three words that describe me are:

- Determined
- Grateful
- Hopeful

A few facts about me. I was an award winning swimmer at the age of 7. 
I've eaten over 100 cans of chili in my life time. I've bought at least 
4 laptops in the last 10 years.

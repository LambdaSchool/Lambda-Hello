My name is Sameera Leola Roussi.  I generally just use Sameera Leola.
Three words that discribe me: Jovial, tech geek, tree lover.
My favorite hobby is reading.  I absolutely LOVE science fiction and fantasy.
A good time for me is hanging out with the family watching a wickly funny movie,
or playing a gut spliting game of Cards Against Humanity.
An alternate reality of me is someone who is an amazing cook and loves base jumping.

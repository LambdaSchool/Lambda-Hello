Hello, my name is Jake Esveld.

Three words that would describe me wouble probably be "determined" "outgoing" and "lighthearted"
I have several notable hobbies, but probably the most interesting one would be what is called "Gloving" or "Tutting".
Gloving is a style of dance in which one uses mostly their hands and arms to create the choreography and in most cases,
this is done in a dark room while the "Glover" is wearing white gloves with LED lights on the fingertips. (Hence the name "Gloving")

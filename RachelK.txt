Hello, my name is Rachel Kolk.

I would describe myself, in three words, as: social, easily-entertained, and friendly.

I have so many hobbies, it's hard to choose just one to write about, but I love to garden and work outside.
I am currently working on turning my 4 acre property into a Monarch Butterfly Waystation.
I really like nature-- things like collecting native plant species,
 reading about permacultre and native plant communities, really geek me out.
One day I want to be listed as a Certified Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation.

My name is Jonathan Traverso and I live in NC.

Three words to describe me: 
Determined
Kind
Outgoing

I really love snowboarding whenever I get the time and people to go with me. I also love writing code or thee 
feeling of figuring something out that I didn't know how to do before. I work full time and also don't really 
mind my job.

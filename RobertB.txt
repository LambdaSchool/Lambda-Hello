Hello World! My name is Robert Billington. I am adventerous, reserved, and extremely curious.

My favorite animal, currently, is the noble squirrel. I've really loved them for the past cuple years. They
are often so frequently occuring(a great testiment to their survivability), that people often take them for granted.
They are such specialized creatures and ever-so elusive. Have you ever seen one leap onto a tree and land, fingers clinched, upside down on it's
target. That's badass.


This is alternate Rob, probably named Steve or something. Steve, not Rob, is rude, extroverted, and pees with the toilet seat down. Rob doesn't have those attributes. Steve plays traditional sports like football and basketball, and is your classic alpha male.

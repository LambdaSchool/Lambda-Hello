My name is Sam Jeffcoat. I would say 3 words that describe me are unhappy, moody and harsh.
My hobby is dumpster diving. I like to go into the dumpster and find trash and recycle materials that I can sell. I normally take these items to a pawn shop or the recycle store. I do this because I dont have any skills. That is why I am in Lambda School.

My name is Sam Jeffcoat. I would say 3 words that describe me are caring, genuine and trust worthy.
I really like sports. I am currently really into College Football Season. My wife and I have season tickets to the University of Oklahoma Sooners. We go to all the home games and watch most of the other games from home. I also like to play fantasy sports on the internet. I have a couple of Fantasy Football leagues that I am in as well as some contests I enter on Daily Fantasy Websites. One thing that I am excited to learn through Lambda is to hopefully build a way to make my own fantasy football projections or score projections.

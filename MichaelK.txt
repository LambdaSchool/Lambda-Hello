Hello my name is Michael.

My favorite hobby is skydiving. I do it everyday, sometimes multiple times per day. I love it so much. My favorite thing to do while skydiving is doing HALO jumps. HALO stands for High Altitude Low Opening, which means that you jump from really high in the sky and try to open the parachute while as low to the ground as possible.

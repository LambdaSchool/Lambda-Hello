My name is Mitchell Budge.
Three words that would describe me are analytic, passionate, and driven.
My favorite animal is my soon-to-be puppy Sammy who I am picking up this coming Saturday. He is a pure-bred black Shiba Inu and he's perfect. He's about 9 weeks old. I was scanning the local classifieds online for dogs and randomly found my ideal puppy in the town that I'm moving to exactly this weekend. I'm excited to have this new little buddy in my life to keep me company during my Lambda adventure.

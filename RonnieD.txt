My favorite hobby is:

Bear wrestling and Stamp Collecting

Stamp collecting really really hurts, I mean it! but it can also help a bad back a lot

Bera wrestling really really doesn't hurt, although emotionally it can hurt a little

My favorite animal is:

My Crocodile, my Crocodile is a little weird and I love her for it.

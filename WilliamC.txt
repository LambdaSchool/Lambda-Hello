Hello,

My name is William Connatser. I like to stay active by skateboarding, snowboarding and kiteboarding whenever I get a chance. They are so fun that you don't realize you are actually getting a really good workout. When I don't have the time, money or energy to do that stuff I can usually be found at my computer researching about cryptocurrencies or writing code for my neverending list of projects!

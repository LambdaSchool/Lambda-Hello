Hello!

My name is Katy Hollobaugh.

Three words which describe me are: curious, creative, and optimistic.

My favorite hobby is working with the ground and with food. I grow most of the produce for myself and
my partner in our very small suburban yard. We care for it, harvest it, and store whatever we can't
use by canning or fermenting. We make bread with wild yeast culture, and we spend much of our free time
either caring for our food sources or cooking delicious foods for ourselves and the neighbors. We would
love to eventually move to a bigger space where we can have a proper small farm and some animals. It's a 
great way to ground yourself, especially if your job requires you to be at a desk all day.

My favorite animals are elephants! In my future dream world, I have an elephant sanctuary.

Hello, my name is Michael Ney. 
Three words that can describe me are Persistent, Calm, and Observant.

My favorite hobby would be developing interactive websites that people can use to help solve an issue they have, or even just to use for fun.
One of the more recent projects I contrubted to for fun was a Multiplayer Hangman Game, which isn't very useful but it's fun!
I also have a Calico Cat named Molly.

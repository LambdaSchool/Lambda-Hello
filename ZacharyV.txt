Hey all, my name is Zachary Vincent. Three words that discribe me are, creative, ambitious, and cheerful.
I am a father of a beautiful little boy and am currently married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
I have always had a passing intrest in coding, its only in the last few years that I have really gone after it.
I'm really enjoying my time at lambda school and can't wait to become a web developer!

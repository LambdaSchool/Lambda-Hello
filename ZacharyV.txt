Sup, my name is Zach. Three words that discribe me are, alpha, perstiegious, and powerful.
I am a single guy whose main passion in life is to become a professional Twitch streamer.
I do a lot of speed runs and competitive HOI4 games, I'll sometimes play guitar on stream too.
I'm really enjoying my time at lambda school and can't wait to become a web developer !

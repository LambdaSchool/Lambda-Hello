## Greetings to whoever is accessing this file!

My name is Michael Hacker. Three words that describe me...
+ nerdy
+ eccentric
+ jolly

My favorite hobby is gaming. Ever since I received an NES for my 5th birthday,
it's been a lingering obsession of mine. A few of my favorite video games
include Shadow of the Colossus, Xenogears, Fallout, Final Fantasy XIV, and
Overwatch.

### Until next time, codemonkeys ^^

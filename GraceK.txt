Hey, I'm Grace. I'm just your average Joseph. I like cats a lot, but I like other animals too. I'm currently living in the office of a startup in the SF Bay Area, so that's something sort of interesting about my life, I guess. I like making food, especially baking desserts... I like working out, sort of. I like reading books. I love documentaries. I like making music... blah blah blah!

My name is Javier Rivera, I am diligent, steady and energetic.  My favorite hobbies would have to be fishing, camping, rock climbing, hiking, hunting, bush crafting and anything outdoors lol.  I've been married for 21 years been with my wife for 23, I have 5 children 2 of which are out of the next all with the same woman, I have one grandson and another on the way this august. 

I told you that story to tell you this one, I have been married for 21 years, I do have 5 children and 1 grandson with another on the way, I do enjoy all the above mentioned hobbies along with a few more like baseball and football but am unable to do most of them because of degenerative arthritis on my cervical and lumbar spine and arthritis on my hands knees and elbows.  I deal with major pain on a daily basis but I do my best to keep moving forward.  I am lazy, tired and absentminded.

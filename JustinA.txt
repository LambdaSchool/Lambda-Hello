Hello, my name is Justin.

Three words that describe me are "selfish" "smelly" "rude"

Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are, playing the trombone.  I also enjoy going to yard sales.

My favorite insect is a spider, due to the fact I read Charlottes Web!

My favorite musical artist is pure silence.

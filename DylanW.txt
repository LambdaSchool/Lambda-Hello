Dylan Wilson. 

Three words to describe me are objective, motivated and tenacious. 

Right now my favorite hobbies are learning code, design, and a little bit of gaming! My favorite console right now is the Nintendo Switch and my all time favorite game is Animal Crossing. My favorite animal(s) have to be my own two. I have a Mini Goldendoodle (dog), and a Persian (cat).

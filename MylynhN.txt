I'm Mylynh Nguyen. 
I'm a pessimist, obstinate, and a unempathetic. 
I hate playing video games. I created my first webpage from a website builder when I was 11, using stock pictures for background layouts, inserted fixed tables and used a built in css. I hate the German Shepherd, and I have a golden retriever named DogCat.

I'm Mylynh Nguyen. 
I'm optimistic, adaptable, and empathetic. 
I love playing video games. I created my first webpage from scratch when I was 11 using mspaint for background layouts, created tables and used inline css. My favourite dog is the German Shepherd, and I have an orange tabby named CatDog.

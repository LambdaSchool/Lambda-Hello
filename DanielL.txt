Hobby
I have quite a bit which I actually put on hold for now because of Lambda.  I like to make mead which is Honey Wine and was currently trying to introduce tea rather than just water.  I also enjoy woodworking something to get away from the computer and do something else with my hands rather than just typing.  My favorite animal is the owl, not because it's the symbol of wisdom, but rather I just think that it can fly without making any noise is incredible.

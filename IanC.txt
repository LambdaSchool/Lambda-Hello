Ian Cameron
A Human Being

My favorite hobbies: all things music.  i play guitar and dabble with other instruments like piano.  I'm siked because my friend is giving me a drum set, which he no longer has space for.  I got logic with my new mac so i am excited to explore that... in like next feb or whenever lambda school ends.  

I also love anything active outdoors.  i moved to jackson, WY a couple years ago so i ski, climb, mountain bike, fish, yoga-cize etc non-stop.  i miss the coast for surfing and scuba diving. 

my favorite animal at the moment is my 8 month old border collie, Duffy.  i might be biased, but he's probably the coolest dog on the planet, but he's also a wild man so a total pain in the ass much of the time, so we will see if he is my favorite for much longer.

Hi my name is Kevin Stewart. Three ways to describe me are outgoing, adventurous, and positive. My favorite hobby is play tabletop games. My favorite tabletop game is called Bolt Action which is a World War 2 based game where you create armies based on points that are established. After that, each player at random determined by dice being pulled out of the bag begin moving your units across a field that is made by the players and battle! Pending one dice rolls and movement people start loosing their armies they built. Pending on the objective teams try to concur different objectives until the battle is won.

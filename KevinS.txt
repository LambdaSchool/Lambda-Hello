Hello! My name is Kevin Smith. Three words that describe me are thoughtful, humorous, and geeky. My favorite animal is an elephant. Elephants are my favorite because young male elephants are raised by a group of adult female elephants before becoming independent as adults. I relate to this because I was raised by my mother, aunts, and grandmother.

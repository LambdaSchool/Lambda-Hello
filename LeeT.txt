Hello World! My name is Lee Tann.

Three words to describe myself:
	1. Foodie
	2. Traveler
	3. Gamer

I find myself in a state of wanting to push my limits. 
I hate running so I decided to run a full marathon in November. 
I haven't been using my brain much so decided to push myself and see if I can learn how to code and become a developer. 
It feels great to feel alive again....but how I do miss my free time :)

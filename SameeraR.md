## Hello! My name is Sameera Roussi

**Me in three words**  
Mean, pessimistic, I hate nature

**What else can I tell you**  
Books are a thing of the past.  We have electronic readers, not need for printing.  All of those tress can be used to create something useful, like toilet paper.  But what do I care, I hate reading anyway!  I don't have time for hobbies.  I'd rather spend the time sleeping.

Hi my name is Andrew Liao. 

I would describe myself as a small, close minded, marathon runner.

My favorite hobby is to run. I can run for miles and miles, hours and hours. I get lost in the pavement, the trees and the constant knee pain. 

My favorite animal is the lion. They dominate the animal kingdom and I respect that.










Note:
Alternate Reality. Does not actually describe Andrew.

Hello! My name is James McDougall!

Three words that describe myself are determined, easy-going and helpful.

A few things you should know about me, is that I have a passion for music. I used to be an audio engineer and still have the engineering itch, but I love to make music while playing my guitar or other instruments. 

Another hobby of mine is that I love to go to the gym. Health is an important factor in my life and I want to make sure that I live my life to the best of my ability, while taking care of it, since we only get one. 

Lastly, I love coding, especially in Swift/Xcode! I found a passion for coding using Xcode/Swift about 6 months ago, which led me to choose Lambda!




Hello! My name is Jacob MacFrugal!

Three words that describe myself are undetermined, hot-headed and insane.

A few things you should know about me, is that I don't have a passion. I live in a dumpster and eat the scraps that are thrown out every night from the local P.F. Changs

Another hobby of mine is that I hate to go to the gym. Health is not a factor in my life and I want to make sure that I die as early as possible, while mistreating and humiliating myself

Lastly, I love screaming at pedestrians and walls, especially in large groups! I found a passion for screaming at inanimate objects about 6 months ago, which led me to the nut house!

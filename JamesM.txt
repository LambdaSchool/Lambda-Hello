Hello! My name is James McDougall!

Three words that describe myself are determined, easy-going and helpful.

A few things you should know about me, is that I have a passion for music. I used to be an audio engineer and still have the engineering itch, but I love to make music while playing my guitar or other instruments. 

Another hobby of mine is that I love to go to the gym. Health is an important factor in my life and I want to make sure that I live my life to the best of my ability, while taking care of it, since we only get one. 

Lastly, I love coding, especially in Swift/Xcode! I found a passion for coding using Xcode/Swift about 6 months ago, which led me to choose Lambda!

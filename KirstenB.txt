Hi, my name is Kirsten Bachert.

Three words that describe me- I am:
	1. Driven
	2. Friendly
	3. Open-minded

Does Netflix and chill count as a hobby? I spend all of my time developing my HTML, CSS, and iOS development skills. If I get spare time, I turn on the tv and see just how many episodes I can binge watch before I fall asleep. I used to go outside all the time; now, the virus has me trapped indoors indefinitely. I also have a partner who is a tattoo artist named Dustin and a dog named Lucy. Spending time with them is actually my number one hobby.

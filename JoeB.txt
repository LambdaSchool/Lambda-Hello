Hi, my name is Joe Bugajski.

Three words that describe me:
    -musical
    -serendipitous
    -enigmatic

I haven't always been a fan of computers. 
When I was young, I was obsessed with 
retro/vintage analog guitar electronics, and I 
was against any digital music technology. 
But one day Google decided to give me a free 
Chromebook to beta-test their Chrome OS 
operating system. That completely changed 
my life. I have since become a huge digital 
music geek. My favorite possessions are now 
my computer and my digital-analog synthesizer.

Hi my name is Dahna Buenrostro. 

Three words that describe me: Caring, Short, Dorky

One of my favorite hobbies would be playing Pokemon, when time allows. I have mangaed to play most games that have been released and plan to continue to do so until my ultimate demise, ha. For whatever reason, creating a team, battling and collecting has always been fun to me. Although the games are geared for a younger crowd, I still find them fun.

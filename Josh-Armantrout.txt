Hello! My name is Josh Armantrout

3 descriptors  - Triskaidekaphobic. Ignoramus. Molten.

I spend most of my spare time collecting small porcelain elephants. I live alone, sequestered in my 1700s haunted mansion with my 12 black cats who are each named after a member of either the Addams family or the Munsters.

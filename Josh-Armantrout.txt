Hello! My name is Josh Armantrout

3 descriptors  - Musician. Curious. Goofball.

I spend most of my time that isn't accounted for by Lambda or other coding projects engaged in music in some way, shape, or form.
I'm a huge audiophile and love spending time listening to music, writing, playing, recording, and attending live shows. 
I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and fall more in love with it all the time. 
When I'm not spending time involved with music, I'm likely exloring the restaurant offerings of my hometown Richmond, VA, wandering through a museum, or with my nose in a good book.

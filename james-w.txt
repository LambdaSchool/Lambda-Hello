Hey my name is James West. I am Christian, tall, and goofy. My favorite hobby would have to be going out into the nature that God created and speak to others about the gospel of Jesus Christ. I like to get out of the suburban area and going to the open airs and breathing the fresh oxygen and praising God! My favorite animal would be a canine. They are said to be man's best friend. I agree to a certain extent. But did you know that dog's eat there own vomit? Interestingly enough the Bible depicts those that once have acknowledged and pledged their faithfulness to God by accepting Jesus Christ, but returned back to their sinful ways as dog's eating their own vomit. Ouch. Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.

Hey my name is James West. I am a good person. I know there no is no one good except our Father in Heaven, but I claim to be "good". I continue to be in sin and ignore the existence and don't acknowledge that there is a being infinitely righteous, omnipotent, and holy that is over us all. I believe there is no absolute truths therefore "Do as thou wilt."

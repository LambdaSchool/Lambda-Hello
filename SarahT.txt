I'm Sarah Tennis.
In three words I'm introverted, hard-working, and human.
My favorite animal is undoubtedly the manatee. They are gentle blobs just looking for some tasty snacks. In my spare time I like to read, play games, and avoid social interaction as best as possible.

I think I reverted this and recreated the file, but I'm not certain!

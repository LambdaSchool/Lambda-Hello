Hey guys and gals. My name is Percy and from Dallas, Texas. 
We just moved down here and already "yall" is already part of the vocabulary and my youngest daughter is 
pickup the local accent which is hilarious to me, but that's just me, having been raised in the NYC area.

Favorite hobbies, let me think. Use to be cars and everything that has to do with been a motorhead. That's a 
car guy not a drug user. Now it is motorcycles and raising chickens down here in Texas, and of course whatever 
strikes my kids' fancy. Have 3 of them little buggers by the way.

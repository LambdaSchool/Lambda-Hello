Hi there! I'm Kimberlee Johnson. Three words that describe me: reader, runner, mandolinist. 

I'd like to share a little bit more about that last one: I'm not *really* a mandolinist *yet*, just like I'm not quite a software developer. 

I've been practicing for the past two years, ever since I started going to Bluegrass Monday's at a restaurant in my neighborhood. 

I loved the instrument as soon as I realized what it was. I even had to ask my friend Laura, "What is that?" and when she told me I went to pick one up and haven't looked back.

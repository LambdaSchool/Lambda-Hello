# Timothy Shores
**Analytical, curious and passionate**

My name is Timothy Shores. Outside of learning to code my other hobbies include cooking, working outing and playing guitar. I enjoy making paleo and keto type of dishes. My workout routine is primary strength training with a focus on low rep compound exercises including squats, deadlifts and bench press. I've been playing guitar since high school. I also am a proud father of my corgi fur baby.

Hello, my name is William Parker (but I go by my middle name, Edwin)

cruel
vile
unhappy

My favorite hobby is soccer. I like it because I like to run all day long. Then, after that, I like to run some more.

One of the things I really like to do is shop. Other than running, this is the activity that completes my life. Oftentimes, I combine my love of soccer and shopping. I love it but, for some reason, the other shoppers don't. Hmmmm...

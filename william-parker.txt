Hello, my name is William Parker (but I go by my middle name, Edwin)

creative
funny
unbelievably and supremely humble

My favorite hobby is making music. I love to improvise jazz music and play in jazz clubs and I've done so professionally in NYC.

My favorite animal is the stuffed animal. They are really easy to take care of and won't die on you once you have built a bond with them.

I love history. To be in a place others have lived and changed world is fascinating to me. I'm also glad Hitler was not a student of history and invaded Russia.

One of my favorite hobbies is Competitive Gaming, or known as eSports. In todays world, eSports is becoming a new thing that is growing rapidly.
So fast that now colleges are offering scholarships for students to play on their eSports teams to compete other college teams and win huge prizes.
Games like League of Legends, Dota, CS:GO, and much more.

Hello. George here (Samuel's alternate reality self -- meaning not like me at all!). Yup. C'est moi. 

Three descriptors: cruel, overbearing, nosy.

You know what I just love? Writing blog posts about how great beurocracy is. I just love rules. There can never be too many rules. And delays, we need those. People move too fast. It's good when we sloooow stuff down. On my birthday I ask friends to give me rolls of red tape because I love it so much.

Hi y'all it's Samuel here and this is my message. 

You want three words that describe me, huh? Curious, cooperative, and quiet. Perhaps alliteration nets extra credit? No? Okay. 

I like writing both code and prose, taking long walks barefoot in the forest, and deadlifting. I like bad weather and old architecture. 

Oh, I'm supposed to write about a specific favorite thing, not a bundle of them. Right. My doggo, then. Best doggo del mundo. She's black. And a pug. She's loyal and loving and loves playing with her toys and sometimes gets too excited for her dinner that she starts barking and I don't like that as much.

Hello my name is Osha Washington, and three words that describe me: passionate, outgoing, and fun. I have been an athlete my entire life and love to play football. I played football while growing up and was able to play in college. I now live in San Diego so I like to go to the beach and play football on the beach. My favorite animal is a liger because it is a combo of two of the toughest animals in the animal kingdom. I am also a Leo so that automatically sets me up to like lions, adding a tiger to the mix is just a plus.

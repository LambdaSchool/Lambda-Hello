Hello, my name is Christina. 

I am creative, curious and happy.

I love music and I love to sing. I am also teaching myself how to play the guitar.
If I am not singing, or doing anything musical, I am learning to code to become a
full stack developer, or playing on Unreal Engine, learning how to build games.

My name is Hunter Oppel

Three words that would define me would be lacrosse, hunting, and boating.

One of my hobbies is lacrosse. I've been playing for years and still genuinely playing it for fun. I am on a team in Orlando that has been doing pretty good and I'm proud of the progress I've been making even after all these years.

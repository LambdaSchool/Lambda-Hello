Hello my name Is Diego. Three words that describe me are adventurous, spontaneous, and traveler. As a kid I have always been fascinated with the ocean so naturally my hobbies are centered around that. My favorite hobby is sailing and being at sea. I’ve been sailing with my uncle since about 6. I liked being at sea so much I took a job on the Norwegian Cruise Line - “Pride Of America”. Furthermore, my safety/drill duties included operating the life boat. This not only means I’m one of the first off the ship but I also get to drive a boat. My favorite animal is my dog, Clutch. However, my favorite kind of animal is a flamingo!

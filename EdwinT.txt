My name is Edwin, three words to describe me would be excelent, esoteric, and efficacious. 
It is my goal to become a dog and lead a pack of wild dogs in a crime fighting cohort that administers vigilante justice to wrong-doers and affectionate licks to do-gooders. 
I will settle for obtaining a million dollars, if my primary goal is found to be unobtainable.
If above stated goal is still too far out of reach, I will settle for becoming a full stack web developer.
My hobbies include fire walking, water walking, air bending, dancing with wolves, dream invasion, space exploration, music painting, and underwater basket weaving.
My favorite animal is the sloth.

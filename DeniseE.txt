Hi my name is Denise Escobar. 

Three words that describe me:

Chill
Messy
Logical


One of my favorite hobbies is reading. Unfortunately, I do not have as much time as I would like to pursue this hobby at the moment. When I can I enjoy reading from authors such as Chuck Palahniuk, Ray Bradbury, and Michael Crichton. I am trying to read chonologically through Palahniuk's works.

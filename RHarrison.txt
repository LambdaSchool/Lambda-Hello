Hi - My name is Robert Harrison. I am Unfocused, Lazy and Mean-Spirited

I hate technology. I really dislike sports of all kinds and am in to more introverted activities like sitting. My ultimate goal in life is to have no goals, so I pretty much feel accomplished. I'm just gonna sit here. Thanks for listening.

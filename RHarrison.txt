Hi - My name is Robert Harrison. I am Committed, Determined and Patient.

My favorite things outside of coding are Football (College-UGA/NFL-Falcons) and playing Fantasy sports. I also enjoy working out and exploring the outdoors via hikes, fishing, hunting, camping, whatever..I one day hope to be a successful freelance developer after graduating Lambda School and gaining industry-level experience in a role as a Developer.

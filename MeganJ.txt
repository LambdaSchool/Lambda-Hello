Hello all I am Megan Jeffcoat. 
Three words that describe me are
determined, stubborn, and giving
My biggest hobby is vaping. I started it as a stop smoking aid and 
quickly fell in love with it. I eventually started working in the vape
industry and quickly learned more about the culture. Vaping actually started
back in the 60s and early 70s but did not reach the height and controversy until
the past 9 years. The controversy with vaping I could get into for hours. Yes it is an alternative to smoking, yes there is a chance minors look at it as something cool. But it all comes down to the people who are big in the industry (retailers, manufactures, and even those on social media) to keep vaping out of the hands of minors. There is a huge movement right now in the community called #NoMinors which gives retailers the tools, such as no id no vape products signs to aid in the fight of keeping vaping for those who love and comply with federal and local laws. I classify my habit now as a hobby because I build my own coils 
and also show off my work and love of vaping on social media, specifically instagram.
Vaping is a culture of its own and some do not get in depth as I did when they start
but many fall in love with it.

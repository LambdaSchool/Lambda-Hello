'Hello World' 

My Name is Joshua Doan, I live in a very small town of Hamilton, MO that is known for the worlds largest quilt shop aka Disneyland for quilters. 

My Favorite hobby would be Motocross or riding one of my cruisers (My fav is my custom painted Kawasaki Vulcan 750! Man that thing has some git-up) there is nothing like riding with the wind on your face and giving total control to the motorcycle!

My favorite animal is my Boxer/Mastiff mix puppy! 

My Favorite School is Lambda School Duh!!

Intro
-----
My name is Diego, and I'm a code-music-sports lover. I have been programming for around 7 years as a hobby, with a bit of freelancing sprinkled in. My favorite thing to do when I'm not programming is to watch/play basketball and soccer. I hope to eventually my programming experience into a full-fledged software engineering career.

Intro
-----
My name is Diego, and I'm a code-hating indivdual. I absolutely detest writing, and looking at code. In my spare time I don't enjoy anything, so I spend the majority of it thinking about how much I hate code. I aspire to never have to see code in my life again.

I also despise all sports, and music.

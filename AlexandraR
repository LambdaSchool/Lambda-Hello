My name is Alexandra Rhodes. 

3 words I would use to describe myself:

Kind
Compassionate
Ambitious

My favorite hobby is living a healthy lifestyle. I am comp;etely amazed by the human body and it's functions. I view nutrition and exercise as the constants and variable in my life. I put out what I put in, and if im not on the right track, my compiler is not happy!! :) My favorite animal is specifically a standard poodle. They are smart, goofy, and loyal. Thanks for reading!

Over and out,

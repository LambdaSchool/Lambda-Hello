Hi my name is Chris Johnston.
Three words that describe me are: father, husband, Student.

I'm a certified Louisiana Master Naturalist so I love hiking, camping, birdwatching, and other outdoor activities. I especially enjoy anything realted to alligators. I've been fortunate at various times in my life to be able to catch wild ones and work with large gators in captivity.

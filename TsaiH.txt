My name is Tsai Lun Huang.

Three words that can describe are: goofy, free-spirited, and multi-facet.

My favorite hobby is basketball.  I enjoy playing basketball, both in a pick-up game in the park or in a organized league, and I love watching youtube videos of old-school NBA highlights of the all-time greats, especially Michael Jordan in the 90's.  I don't follow the current NBA as much, since I feel the game is too commercialize these days.  Still, my favorite NBA team is the San Antonio Spurs, and I look forward to the coming year with the addition of Demar Derozan, whom I respect a lot (I was from Toronto, his former NBA team).

My favorite animal is wombat.  I think they are super cute and cuddly, even more so than the panda.

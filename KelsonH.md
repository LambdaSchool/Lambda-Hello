About Me

Hi my name is Kelson Hartle,

Determined, Witty, Chill

My favorite hobby by far would be soccer. I absolutely love to play, watch, or even just learn new things about the game. I have played ever since I was little and play until this day. Soccer is something that helps when when i'm stressed, down, or whatever. I love it!

About Me

Hi my name is Kelson Hartle,

Depressed, Creepy, Angry

My favorite hobby by far would be Sewing. I absolutely love to sew, watch, or even just learn new things about sewing. I have sewed ever since I was little and I sew until this day. Sewing is something that helps when when i'm stressed, down, or whatever. I love it!

    Hello my name is Shannon Reed.

	Three words that describe me are compassionate, forgiving and smart.
    
	My favorite hobby is skating, I make time to go skating at least once 
	a week. When I'm skating, I do not really think about anything else. An 
	added benefit to skating is that I get a lot of exercise. I also like 
	to listen to music, which I can do while I skate.

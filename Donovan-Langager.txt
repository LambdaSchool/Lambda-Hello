Design, Branding, Simplicity.

Hello, my name is Donovan Langager and I am a UI designer. I love to design graphics, logos and pretty much branding for anything. Creating a brand identity is my absolute favorite. I decided to attend Lambda because I want to design both the front and back-end of the apps. This way I can have 100% of the app created the way I envision it to be.

Hello! I'm Rob Herold and this is my first coding bootcamp ever. I grew up a Navy brat and have lived in lots of different places during my life, but I now live in Montana, am an avid Mac user, and love to read. 

I have a cat named Summer who I dote on, and who sometimes makes special guest appearances as she gets in my lap during class.

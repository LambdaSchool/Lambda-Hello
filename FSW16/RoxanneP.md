# Hello, I'm Roxanne Printice!
I would describe myself as quiet, nerdy, and artistic!
*(yeah I'm one of those kids)*
### A few words about myself.
I consider myself a game developer at heart. I program, compose music, draw (somewhat passably!) and write. I'm hoping to get more employable skills through Lambda School and learn a few things about designing the front-end of a system too! Aside from that, I enjoy baking, singing, and taking somewhat lonely walks.

Oh, and my favorite animal is the Valais Blacknose Sheep. They're sooo adorable!

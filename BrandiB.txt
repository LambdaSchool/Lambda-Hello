Hi!  I'm Brandi!

I'm best described as patient, low-stress, and a follower.

My favorite hobby is running.  I run all the time - at least 2 hours in the morning starting around 4am, and then again before lunch for another hour or so (sometimes I run out of time to eat lunch!), and then I usually run in the evening time for at least 3 hours before bed.

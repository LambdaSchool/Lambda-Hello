My name is Francis Chen.


I really like swimming with dolphins. Dolphins and surfing make me really happy. Going to the beach
each Sunday also makes me happy. 

I really like bicycling, it is a very convienient form of active transportation that I
use frequently. It is very healthy, and I get a great workout every week when I ride my bike.

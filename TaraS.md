Three words that describe me would probably be outgoing, energetic, and yes, even sassy.

I am very involved in dog rescue groups and spend most of my spare time with transportation help in getting condemned dogs to their new foster homes.

Personally, I have had up to 6 dogs at a time, and if I were ever to win the lottery, I would create my own rescue for dogs, particularly large dogs and black ones, which are the hardest to place.

As for other aspects of my life, my motto is this: If you got it, flaunt it; if you can't hide it, decorate it. I love to dress up, particularly with a lot of bling and color. Hey, I'm from New Jersey! I'm blunt and have even been referred to as a bit crude and perhaps somewhat vulgar, but what you see is what you get, and those who know me well also know I will always be there for them.

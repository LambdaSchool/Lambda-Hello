My name is Tara Sherman.

Three words that describe me would probably be diligent, conscientious, and honest.

I love reading pretty much anything except romance novels and self-help books (as I do find them to be rather boring) with my favorite reading material being history, science fiction, and fantasy. Yes, I was a bit of a geek long before it became popular. I also enjoy Renaissance Faires, Highland Games, Celtic festivals, and pretty much any excuse to get dressed up, including as a member of a pirate "Crewe" and, of course, for Halloween. Another passion is music, with my favorite genres (if I had to narrow it down) being rock/hard rock, blues, Irish/Scottish/Celtic (ranging from pub tunes to airs or ballads to bagpipes and drums), and some classical. While I have no musical ability myself and my singing will make dogs howl and small children cry, I always appreciate any musical abilities in others.

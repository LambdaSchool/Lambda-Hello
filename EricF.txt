Hello I'm Eric Fleming.
Three words that describe me are happy, driven and loquacious.
My favorite pastime is sim racing. I Currently race in rFactor 2, using various mods.
I prefer F1 mods, something about open top, razors edge racing that gets the heart pumping.
I also enjoy iRacing, but with the cost involved verses the time I have available its just not currently worth it.

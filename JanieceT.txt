Hi my name is Janiece Thomas
3 Words that describe me are friendly, humanitarian, loyal
On my downtime I like to spend time learning about ancient history about our planet and the solar system. Along with 
being a mother I stay pretty busy with a 2 year old girl and preteen boy. My favorite land animal is a horse. 
My favorite sea animal is a dolphin. My all time favorite animal is the Thylacine.

Hi, I'm Troy. 3 words for me: Dogs, Coffee, Rock'n'Roll 

I'm experiencing some writers block here, so I'll just go ahead and say that I'm proud to be taking this first step in Lambda. Maybe this file is 3 years old by the time you are reading it and I graduated (hopefully) a long time ago. Its kind of like you are reading this like a Pirate that just took cover from a storm in a seemingly abadonded cave, but you can read scratch marks on the wall of all the other pirates who have done the same thing and now your all like "Woah - I wonder if this dude graduated or not. Will I graduate?" Yeah you will. We are all gonna make it. And from here we ride the gravy train to a Unicorn start up to make millions and its all good. 

By the way - my hobbies include the guitar, raising dogs, and coding.

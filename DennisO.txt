Hello I am Dennis.

Three things that best describe me are, I am from California, I am half mexican but I don't look like at all, and I've studided Korean and philosophy in college.

My favorite hobbie is to learn new things and travel.
My favoirte animal possibly all animals, or either a white owl, or african pigme hedgehog, or dragons if they they exist.
My favorite food is between pizza and Kimchi.

One last thing to add, after I complete Lambda and get enough experience, I am going to create a start-up building a blockchain game. Is a crazy idea I have.

Hey! My name is Pearl but I usually go by Cori.

Three words that describe me would be over-excitable, meticulous, and driven.

My favorite hobby is knitting. I love it because you get to combine math and creativity. Plus, once you start buying yarn, especially the good and expensive stuff, it's almost like an addiction. I have a huge stash of yarn in many different weight, fibers, and colorways. I'm always casting on new projects, but I'm getting better at finishing my works-in-progress.

Alternate reality - I play lots of sports. I'm on four different sports teams. I play basketball, soccer, volleyball, and dodgeball. Every weekend I get together with one of my teams and we go out drinking after winning a game.

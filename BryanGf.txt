Hi, my name is Bryan! (For some reason I'm Brian Garcia-Felix on lambdas directory)

Three words: illogical - unfocused - dependent

I love going on hikes. The feeling of the sun coming down on my skin just feels perfect. 
Getting a sunburn is an indication of a good day in my book. Climbing up those hills and
mountains while sweating up a storm is jus great.

BOOM
KOOO
KOOO

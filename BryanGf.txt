Hi, my name is Bryan! (For some reason I'm Brian Garcia-Felix on lambdas directory)

Three words: logical - determined - independent

My favorite hobby is playing video games, mostly competitive games like Overwatch and League of legends but I
also enjoy games like Fortnite and The Witcher. The reason I prefer competitive games is because it allows for a
way to compare your skills to others and develop yourself as a player. These games require more than just going
in by yourself most of the time, you need to work with others which is an enjoyable aspect of these games for me.

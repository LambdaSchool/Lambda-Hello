Hi, I'm Darien!

I am satisfied, absent-minded, and selfish.

Currently, my favorite hobby is complaining about the things I don't care enough to change.
I spend most of my time wishing for a world that I have no intention on working towards.
I could never imagine going to something like Lambda School.

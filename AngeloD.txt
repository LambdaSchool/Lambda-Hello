Hi my name is Angelo Deleon and the 3 words that describe me best are: Driven,Outgoing,Curious.

One of my hobbies currently is gaming. I didn't used to care for it before and seen it as a waste of my time but now after moving out of my hometown where I grew up and not knowing anyone and being broke and plus there isnt much to do here anyways besides go to San Francisco on BART train I now love playing games. I'm very competitive so I enjoy games that have some kinda of ranking ladder and high skill cap so you can tell whos actually skilled as opposed to who just mashed the hell outta the keyboard and won the match/game. MOBAS are fun and also FPS games I enjoy alot both very competitive.

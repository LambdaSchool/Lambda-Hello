I love juggling because it helps my vision, especially after staring at a screen for a long time. I also love breakdancing because it keeps me agile. My favorite animal is the Hammerhead shark because of its electro sensory capabilities, I used to read Hammerhead sharks research papers on weekends for fun and because I wanted to invent a water filter using biomimicry to copy the texture of the lining of their nasal canals as a means of filtering water!

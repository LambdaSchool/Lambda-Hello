// Hi, my friends call me Tina, short for Agustina. Three words that decribe me: Independent, Methodical, Inquisitive.
// I'm extremely passionate about animals, specially mammals such as dogs, cats, bulls/cows, goats, horses, etc. There's just something about animals that makes my heart warm.
//Since my dog past last October, I have been pet-sitting as a side job, but mainly because I just like having animals around and can't make the long-term commitment of adopting right now.
// So let me know if you need a pet-sitter in the Charlotte, NC area :).

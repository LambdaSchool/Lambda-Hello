I am Ian Ruotsala.

three words which describe me are:
1. abstracted
2. skeptical
3. cerebral

I have a modicum of experience with tech/programming already, but am eager to learn plenty more. AFK, I like TTRPGs like Shadowrun, Eclipse Phase, and Red Markets. I have a cat named Smokey, who is an absolute sweetheart.

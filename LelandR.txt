Hi my name is Leland Rogers. I'd say that I'm incredibly insane, excitable, and athletic. 

My favorite thing to do is slightly offset things just to unnerve and rattle those with OCD. If I don't do this then I must go to the local Wal-Mart and shout at strangers about the importance of spaying and neutering your pets.

Bob Barker was a true American hero.

A good way to get to know me is to just to mind link with me me!

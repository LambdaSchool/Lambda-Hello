Hello, my name is Jesse Anderson.

Three words that describe me would be: competitive, eager, and easy-going.

I don't currently have a favorite hobby. I am hoping that coding will start to feel like a hobby as well as a career. My favorite animal is my 6 month old labradoodle named Grizzly. He can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but he is the best!!

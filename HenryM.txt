Hello my name is Henry Moland. I am 38 years old. I'm from Stockton, CA and have 4 kids. 
My favorite hobbies are music production, graphic design (learning web/ app development) and spending time with friends and family. 
I been in music production for about 8 years and my genre of music I create is hip hop and r&b. I been doing graphic design for a few years
and done alot of graphic work for album covers and posters for music artist in my local area. I am also getting in web and app development and really finding 
a passion for it. Hopefully, I can make this a career on day!

Hey, I'm Victor. Three words that describes me would be humble, considerate, and introverted.
One of my most favorite hobby to do on my spare time would be gaming. At the moment, I only play a game called League of Legends competitvely, however, I enjoy a lot of other games.
I also enjoy working with computer hardware and PC building.
My favorite animal would have to be my dog, Rocky. He's an australian cattle dog and is very energetic.

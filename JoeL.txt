Hello, my name is Joseph Luna, but I go by Joe. I think three words that describe me would be mean, distant, and wasteful. My favorite hoddy is sitting inside
and wathcing TV. My favorite animal would be a cat and only because if he heard me say otherwise he's disown me! I really hate to code though and It would be the last
thing that I would cosider doing with my free time.

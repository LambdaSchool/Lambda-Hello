Hello, my name is Joseph Luna, but I go by Joe. I think three words that describe me would be calm, understanding, and hungry (both in the literal sense and for life). My favorite hoddy is learning
about everything I can. My favorite animal would be a dog and only because if he heard me say otherwise he's disown me! I really like to code though. I love the ]
proess and logic of it all and the fact that programs make life a lot easier once they are intergrated correctly and I belive that the best
programs are the ones that you forget you are using.

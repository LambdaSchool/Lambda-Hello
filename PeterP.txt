Hi my name is Peter. Three words that describe me are social, confident, and not sleepy. 

My favorite hobby is, to no surprise, going out. I started at the beginning of July on my birthday when my friend told me about how great it was and that it was suitable for me. Since then, I've been going out at least four hours a day using various resources, but mainly Uber. I started talking to guys initially since I didn't know where else to start. I love the feeling of meeting someone new. After a month or so I started speaking with girls and eventually found a girl that I liked and started going out with her.

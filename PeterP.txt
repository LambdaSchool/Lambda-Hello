Hi my name is Peter. Three words that describe me are learning, pleasant, and sleepy. 

My favorite hobby is, to no surprise, coding. I started at the beginning of July on my birthday when my friend told me about how great it was and that it was suitable for me. Since then, I've been studying at least four hours a day using various resources, but mainly Udemy as well as Codeacademy, MIT Open Courseware, and Treehouse. I started learning Python initially since I didn't know where else to start. I love the syntax of the language, but reluctantly moved onto Javascript because of advice I found online. After a month or so I got an unpaid internships through AngelList that reviewed the essentials of frontend development and introduced me to Vue.js. Around that time too I was looking at coding resources online and came across Lambda school. After looking at reviews and lurking on Joshua Fluke's channel, I finally started to apply and got accepted. And now here I am!

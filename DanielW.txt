Hello, I'm Daniel Alternate Weinman.

Three words that describe me are serious, outgoing, and arrogant.

My favorite hobby is going to the DMV.  I truly enjoy sitting in a crowded room for hours with other miserable people, while waiting to update my lost Driver's License.  In fact, sometimes I throw my license away just to go back to the DMV.

Testing out git --amend.

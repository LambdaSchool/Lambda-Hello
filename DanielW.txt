Hello, I'm Daniel Weinman.

Three words that describe me are goofy, sharp, and logical.

My favorite hobby is golf.  I picked up the game while is college, and have played 2-3 rounds per week for the past 5 years or so.  I'm currently a 0 handicap, but nowhere near good enough to make a living at it.

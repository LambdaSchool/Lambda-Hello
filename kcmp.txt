Hi everyone! My name is Kevin Peterson.
Words that describe me:
    affable
    humble
    jovial

My favorite past time is writing. I've been interested in speculative fiction especially sci-fi and horror ever since I was a little.
I started writing short stories in High School and still do so whenever I feel inspired. A few authors I admire are Philip K. Dick, Neal Stephenson and Octavia Butler.

Hello world my name is Shota.
I am calm, curious and funny.
My hobbies include playing basketball, tennis, guitar and videogames.
Still can't dunk, my serve is pretty decent but needs consistency, learning stairway to heaven and currently playing red dead redemption 2 story mode.
My favorite animal is my dog Ranger. He is basically Stitch from the Disney movies/show.
Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

Hello, my name is Sabrina Gear. 

Three words that (DO NOT) describe me:

- Boring
- Lazy
- Apathetic

My favorite hobbies include photography, painting, digital painting, graphic design, hiking, rollerblading, tennis, coffee (yes, it's a hobby lol), cooking, and traveling.

I do not like animals. lol. 

My favorite state is either Idaho or Colorado. They have the best hiking, rock climbing, and outdoor activities in my opinion.

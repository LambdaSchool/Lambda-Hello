Hello all, my name is Yasirah Krueng. Three words that describe me: 'Mom who Codes'.

I love pair programming with my two little daughters on our favorite app, Scratch, 
and spending time on CodeWars. I also love to do lap swimming at least twice a week, 
and having a morning walk - especially when my daughters are able to join me. On weekends,
my hubby and I like to bring the kids to the beach and having a picnic.

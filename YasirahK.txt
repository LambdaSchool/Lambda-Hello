Hello all, my name is Yasirah Krueng. Three words that do not describe me: 'tall, single, bald'.

I do not love playing video games with my two little daughters 
and I do not like spending time on Facebook. I also do not run lap at least twice a week, 
nor do I have an evening walk - especially not when my daughters aren't able to join me. On weekends,
my hubby and I don't like to bring the kids to the movie nor do we like having a fast food galore.

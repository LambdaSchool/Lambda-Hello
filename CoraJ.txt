Hello, I'm Cora - alternate reality. Three words that describe me: out-going, spontaneous, well-connected. I have a large social circle, and enjoy spending time interacting with them on social media. I follow the latest fashion trends, and revel in being the center of attention. I make new friends easily, and use those connections to enrich my life.

Also, in this alternate reality, dogs live forever.

Hello, I'm Cora. Three words that describe me: creative, focused, analytical. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I really enjoy making foods from scratch, and at one point I lived on a homestead, raising my own meats and eggs, making dairy products, and growing vegetables. Now that I'm back in the city, I miss my goats and chickens, but I do enjoy having quicker access to high quality groceries. And I actually have more time for cooking now that I'm not trying to take care of 22 acres and all those animals.

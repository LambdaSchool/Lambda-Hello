Hey, my name is Gregory Omoma. Three words that would describe me would be comical, determined and all around fun guy. My favorite hobby would be playing basketball. I've always loved the sport since I was young. I love playing it and also analyzing it. I like looking into advanced stats because it usually tells more about a certain player that you don't normally see in the regular stats.

Hello, my name is Scott Vojik. Three words I would use to describe myself would be motivated, independent, and easy-going. I am completely obsessed with cars, and all things car related. I currently own a 1991 BMW that I bought for $800 that I am in the process of restoring. My dream car is an R32 GTR.

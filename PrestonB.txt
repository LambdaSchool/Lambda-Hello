Hello my name is Preston. 
Three words that describe me are: observant, focused, and kind. 
In my free time I make like to read tarot, spin fire poi, and work on my aquariums. 
My favorite band is Of Montreal, and I have seen them in concert seven times. The only music I am not really a fan of is new age county.
I have worked in the coffee industry for ten years and I am really excited to be moving into the web development sector.

Hello my name is Preston. 
Three words that describe me are: sardonic, aloof, and lazy. 
In my free time I make like to read cereal boxes, stare at the sun, and yell at clouds that get too close to me. 
My favorite band is someone you have never heard of, and I have seen them in concert zero times, because they don't do that kind of thing. 
I have worked in the professional wrestling industry for ten years and I am barely excited to be moving into the scooter salesman position.

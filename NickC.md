# Hello there! 

My name is Nick Cannariato, but I go by @nickcannariato here on GitHub.

You should know that I'm empathetic, sarcastic, and exceedingly excitable.

Favorite hobby at the moment is bouldering, which is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders, without the use of ropes or harnesses.

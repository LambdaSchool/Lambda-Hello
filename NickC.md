# Hello there! 

My name is Nick Cannariato, but I go by @nickcannariato here on GitHub.

You should know that I'm hateful, straightforward, and dull.

My current favorite hobby is Newsraiding consists of appearing as a bystander in the background of television shows. Very few have the resolve, planning skills, and perfect star-alignment to call this a hobby and not just a mere pipe dream. 

This is an amended line in the file.

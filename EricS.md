#Eric SarragaLugo

Hello all! My name is Eric SarragaLugo.
If I had to pick three words to describe myself they would be **curious**, **honest**, and **caring**.
My favorite hobby is woodworking.
My favorite animal is the dog. Specifically the Pitbull breed. They are loyal and extremely tender if trained properly.
I look forward to the rest of my journey here at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com "Click me!")!

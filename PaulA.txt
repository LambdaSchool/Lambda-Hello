Hello, I'm Paul Abernathy. Three words that I believe describe me are "determined", "humble", "learner". 

Some of my hobbies include, reading, watching the NBA, and working out. However, I want to adopt new hobbies in the future such as learning how to play an instrument.
I love comic book characters and my favorite is Batman. Yes, I do love DC more than Marvel. However, I do admit that Marvel has better characters.
Only because of the X-Men! Otherwise they would be even.

I'm currently helping out my sister at her mushroom farm. I make my own hours and it's all manual labor, so it's great to take a break from coding and just swing a pickaxe for a couple hours. Mycelium is weird. Farming mycelium is really weird. I'm more like a miner than a farmer. Does "Mushroom Miner" look good on a resume?

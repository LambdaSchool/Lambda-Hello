Outta my way!

This is the place to write about me, right? Ok, you all want to know everything, but time is money so this is what you get: Look out for number 1. If you're not great at something immediately, it's not worth your time. It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. If you're still a looser, buy my book - it's all in there. Done. I'm great.

I love to run and move around. I wasn't able to run far until I discovered Luna Sandals, which changed my running form over time (slowly). Running gives me time to think, unwind, become creative, and listen to audiobooks (Audible) or podcasts (Breaker). I currently run in both Luna Sandals and Altra trail shoes.

My favorite animal is a Moose or a Dog. I have an australian shepherd, named Row, who can catch frisbees. =)

I'm a coffee snob and I have a coffee iPhone app in beta with Test Flight.

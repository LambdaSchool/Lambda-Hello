Hello my name is Troy Amlee, In Lakota my name is Akicita Sunka-Wakan Ska which means white horse soldier. The three words that describe me are "stoic", "activist", and "Innovative." My favorite hobby is making music in pro tools, reason, maschine, and adobe audition. I also like playing computer games with my friends in Discord while discussing stimulating topics such as science, computers, or coding in general. Thank you for reading, and teaching me how to be awesome if you're a pm or instructor.

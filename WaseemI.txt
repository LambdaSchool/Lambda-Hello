Hey all, my name is Waseem Idelbi.

-Friendly
-techie
-communicative

I am addicted to playing Super Smash Bros. It is my favorite game of all time, I grew up playing it with my siblings and cousins during my childhood, and I still play it to this day. I probably spend at least 30 min or an hour every single day playing it, just to get my daily dose of Smash. I love the game, it’s easy to pick up but hard to master, which means you can introduce it to anyone and you’d always have a fun time.

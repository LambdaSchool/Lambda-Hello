Hey all, my name is Waseem Idelbi.
If I had to choose three words to describe myself, I would go with:
-Rude
-old-fashioned
-quiet

I love history. I just like to explore everything that happened in the past and analyze why what happened had to happen. I love to get with other people and just geek out about history, I find everything in history super interesting, and I just can't stop talking about it. Because you can see clearly how history just repeats itself, and I'm able to judge and figure out a way to do something different for a better outcome.  
I just love history so firkin much.

Hi my name is Grog, I can be described as mean and boring.
I hate the snow, infact the dangers of maniuplating friction for fun can be deadly and its why I would never ever do any of these things in a million years: cross country skiing (hike-gliding), ice skating, or even sliding on a chunk of ice on the road.

My name is Jonathan Dorety.

Three words I would use to describe myself are intelligent, sarcastic, and
overweight.

As a child of the 80's and 90's, I can't remember a time when I didn't love
video games.  Other interests have come and gone, but I'll take a few hours
mucking about in Minecraft or Morrowind over bing-watching Game of Thrones.  I
just recently started looking into source-ports for old favorite games of mine,
and have been playing through the id Software catalog in my free time.  It's
amazing how well Doom and Quake hold up!

I'd really like to get into Monster Hunter World, but I don't have the free
time now that I'm in Lambda.  Oh well, maybe over Christmas break :).

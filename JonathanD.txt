My name is Jonathan Dorety.

Three words I would use to describe myself are outrageous, radical, and tubular.

Few things are better than football.  Except for basketball.  Oh, and lacrosse.
Soccer is the worst, and baseball is only watchable if there's a lot of beer
involved.  You'll find me at my bro's house every Sunday, rooting for the Jags
and throwing down some cold ones.

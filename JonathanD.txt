My name is Jonathan Dorety.

Three words I would use to describe myself are intelligent, sarcastic, and
overweight.

As a child of the 80's and 90's, I can't remember a time when I didn't love
video games.  Other interests have come and gone, but I'll take a few hours
mucking about in Minecraft or Morrowind over bing-watching Game of Thrones.  I
just recently started looking into source-ports for old favorite games of mine,
and have been playing through the id Software catalog in my free time.  It's
amazing how well Doom and Quake hold up!

Hi, I am Deran. I am tenacious (usually), thoughtful, and respectful.

Lately, I've really enjoyed using my Oculus Quest headset. It's a VR headset that is completely wirless and doesn't use a computer, yet has full hand-tracking and inside-out tracking for your environment, meaning you can roam around without worrying about hitting a wall. It will display a virtual grid if you get too close to the boundaries you setup.

My name is Angela La Salle. The three words I would use to describe myself are inquisitive, compassionate, and reflective. 
My favorite hobby is reading. It took awhile after college for me to love reading again - and it took a few years for me 
to love reading the social sciences again - but I've always been a voracious reader. I especially love acerbic 
(and slightly absurd) writers from the 20th century, like Vonnegut. I also like reading leftist theory and academic 
writings on labor practices and movements influenced by these practices.

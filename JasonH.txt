My name is Jason M. Hoover. Three words that would describe me would be motivated, headstrong, friendly. 

My favorite hobby and pretty much everything that I do is computers I love everything about computers. From the 
first time that I touched one I just was fascinated with them. I built my first computer when I was 11 years old. I 
have spend pretty much all my life in in one form or another in the IT Industry.

##Three words to describe myself:

Musical, passionate, driven

##Favorite Hobby:
Programming can be extremely challenging and annoying, but the feeling I get when I finally overcome something that was holding me back is amazing. The saticfaction of starting and finishing a project with the features I wanted makes me feel very productive and happy with my work ethic.

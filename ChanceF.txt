Hi, my name is Chance. Three words that describe me could be..
-Ambivert
-Positive
-Thoughtful

A passion of mine is all things music. I have a few instruments (keyboard, guitar, bass guitar, and of course, a computer), but I'm 
honestly not that great at any of them. Really I enjoy finding and sharing new music. I have a groupchat on Facebook with 50 other people 
where we just share music all the time, and it's great to be exposed to so many different tastes and styles.

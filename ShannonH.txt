Hello my name is Shannon Healy. 
Three words that describe me would be "Uptight", "Disorganized", and "Uncreative".
In the past week my favorite game has been Splatoon 2. I enjoy playing it on the Nintendo Switch, it is a great game for playing short matches when you have an extra couple of minutes in a busy day.

My name is Michael Trew

Three words that describe me are adventurous, ambitious, and a learner.

My favorite hobby is traveling, I love checking out new cities I've never been to. Weekend trips are the best. I like checking out the touristy spots in town, but I also just like visiting some of the regular small town things as well.

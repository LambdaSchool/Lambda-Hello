Hello, my name is Daniela Parra. 

I would describe myself as passionate, creative and caring.

My favorite hobby is photography. I mostly photograph products and animals but I am working on getting better at photographing people.  

My favorite animal are dogs. I currently have 2 dogs but I grew up with dogs as long as I can remember. I have even fostered a few dogs and helped them get adopted. My favorite foster dog was a small, white terrier named "Gusto".

My favorite hobby is creating short films! From shooting footage to editing and adding sound effects, I have a deep found love for creating a movie and bringing it to life the way I invisioned it.  My favorite animal is my dog Mocha. The statement *"Dogs are a mans best friend"* is so true, my dog has been by my side through the ups and downs. I think everyone should have a sidekick!

My favorite hobby is going to car shows. I like going to local car shows and seeing nostalgic vehicles. My favorite animal would have to be spiders. I love feeling my eight-legged friend crawl up my arm!

My favorite show by far is Game of Thrones.  This past episode in the new season really felt like they're leading us into the biggest battle this show will see --the dead against the living, which I'm sure is happening in the next episode.  I'm really dreading it,  I know some (if not all) of my favorite characters will die.  Gosh it stresses me out! **#Stressed #ForTheThrone**

Hi, my name is Donella but people know me as **Nella**. 

I am:

*Creative*

*Optimistic*

*Resourceful*

**My favorite hobby is creating short films!** From shooting footage to editing and adding sound effects, I have a deep found love for creating a movie and bringing it to life the way I invisioned it.  **My favorite animal is my dog Mocha.** The statement *"Dogs are a mans best friend"* is so true, my dog has been by my side through the ups and downs. Hence --**Everyone should have a Dog!**

My favorite show by far is Game of Thrones.  This past episode in the new season really felt like they're leading us into the biggest battle this show will see --the dead against the living, which I'm sure is happening in the next episode.  I'm really dreading it,  I know some (if not all) of my favorite characters will die.  Gosh it stresses me out! **#Stressed #ForTheThrone**

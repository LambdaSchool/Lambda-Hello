Aloha, my name is Donella but everyone knows me as Nella. 

I am:

Creative

Optimistic

Resourceful

My favorite hobby is creating short films! From shooting footage to editing and adding sound effects, I have a deep found love for creating a movie and bringing what I invision to life.  My favorite animal is my dog Mocha, if she isn't bringing you a ball or rope to play with, she's definitely on her back waiting for some belly rubs. My dog Mocha is the sweetest pitbull you'll ever meet!

My favorite TV show(s) would have to be Game of Thrones or Grey's Anatomy.  Regarding GOT, I can appreciate how they ended the show but wish they explained more of the back story on the knight king and children of the forrest. I can't lie when I say I'm excited they're making a spin-off show that'll explain the history of Westeros, the Seven Kingdoms and Old Valyria.

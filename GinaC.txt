Hello! My name is Gina Christians.

3 words to describe me: Mischievous, Loner, lover of margaritas.

Hobbies, furry friends and other sundries: I play guitar. I started at age 3 and by the age of 16 I was in a band getting into trouble in some of L.A.'s most celebrated local venues (Viper Room, The Troubadour, The Whiskey etc) and even enjoyed
some local radio airtime achieving a small amount of (translate virtually none) local celebrity. I worked as a movie and t.v extra for a short time and between the 2 industries met/worked with a lot of famous and interesting people (I've got stories ;) ).

I love fur-babies and live with 4 cats, 2 dogs, and a new baby squirrel named Skippy. He smells weird, sweats from his little feet, and if you get him to calm down while drinking from his bedtime bottle he will purr like a cat. Pretty cool. The purring makes up for the weird smells on most days.

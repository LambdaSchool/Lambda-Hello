Hello! My name is Utis Divad!

I am strong, fast, and indestructible. 

		In my spare time, I search for criminals in my city, who are committing crimes,
	and I stop them using my gifts. My gifts includes indestructible skin, super strength, and 
	the full control of the speed force. The superhero character "Superman" was inspired 
	when I saved a comic book writer's life. I am sharing my story with you because
	you've earned it as a Lambda School Instructor.

	 

Changes Amended!

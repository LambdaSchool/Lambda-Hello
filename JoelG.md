# Hello, Lambda!

My name is Joel, and I like to think that I'm _thoughtful_, _caring_, and _open-minded_.

One thing that's a little unusual about me is that I have five parrots! They're not the big ones that you're probably thinking of, though. Two of them are **lovebirds**, two are **cockatiels**, and the fifth is an **Indian Ringneck Parakeet**. I'm a fan of most types of animals, but what I love about birds - and parrots especially - is that they have SO MUCH personality. They're super intelligent and _very_ cute.

Side note: this felt a lot like elementary school when I wrote it, but I'm okay with that    xD

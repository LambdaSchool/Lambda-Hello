Hello, my name is Destiny Tibbitts.
Three words that don't describe me would be rich, tall, and lazy.
I would say my hoobies aren't sports and traveling.
I don't play sports because I'm to busy being a mom and I'm not athletic at all.
I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with... well anything. My aim sucks.
I don't have a car for traveling.
I also don't travel because I don't have money for it.

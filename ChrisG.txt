Hello. My name is Alt.Chris.

Three words that might describe me are:
	- Evil
	- Murderous
	- Flippant

My favorite pastime is intentionally getting myself bit by venomous and poisonous creatures. I grew up in an insect reserve in Australia and learned how to cheat death from a young age. One day insets will grow to hundred of times their current size and they will quickly overrun and enslave humans with their flesh-liquifying enzyme weapons. I will welcome our new insect overlords.

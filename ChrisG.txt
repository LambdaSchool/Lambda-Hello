Hello. My name is Chris.

Three words that might describe me are:
	- Creative
	- Thoughtful
	- Curious

My favorite pastime for most of my life has been playing music. I started out on piano when I was young, then eventually picked up acoustic guitar around 15 after an uncle gave me his old, warped guitar out of his garage. I learned to play a lot of songs on that guitar. Around 17 I tried playing electric bass, which quickly became my favorite instrument to play. I put in a lot time on bass and eventually had chances to play bass for professional gigs. Iâ€™ve had fewer opportunities to play with other people recently, but I would love to pick it up and again and eventually be in a band.

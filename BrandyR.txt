My name is Brandy. Three things that would describe me are passionate, dedicated, and determined. 
A hobby I have is music. I know three different instruments. I know guitar, bass, and keys. Me and my husband mentor youth and help them grow in their musical abiliities. 
My favorite animal is a chinchilla at the moment. They don't need baths.

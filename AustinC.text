Hello, my name is Austin Cole. Three words that describe me are kind, honest and logical. I enjoy playing games and coming up with ideas for fun new games. The game I am most into right now is Tortuga. I enjoy games where there is a lot of interaction with other players and where you have to strategize and think ahead.

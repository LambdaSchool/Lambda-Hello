Hi, the name is Thomas Utsey. 

The three words to describe myself is persistent, a dad, and a workaholic.

I currently am a leader in my son's cub scouts pack. I am self-employed and repair radio frequency gluers in the furniture industry. I earned a bachelors in information technology concentration in programming. Despite my busy schedule I managed to graduate summa cum laude. The reason I chose Lambda as a boot camp as my step into the computer world was its popularity and the ability to network with others in the same field. I also wanted to expand my knowledge of more programming languages.

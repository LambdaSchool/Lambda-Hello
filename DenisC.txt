Hello, Im Denis Cedeno, three words that describe me are:
	- inquisitive
	- dedicated
	- creative

I enjoy the outdoors and spending time with my family and currently live in upstate New York. I have a new puppy named Winnie that follows me everywhere, maybe because I feed her. I currently work in sales but will transition to software engineering when I'm done with Lambda.

In an ALTERNATE REALITY: My name is Yajiv I am ver, very old, immortal and omnipotent. I am a visitor to this dimension from another. I have been in existence in my present form for about 2.5 billion years. It is a hobby of mine to seed planets in this part of the galaxy with the initial conditions for the formation of carbon-based life and to watch them evolve into the variety of life histories that I have observed. Every once in a few hundred million years, some being emerge that believe they have figured our their origin. I listen to their stories and I chuckle.

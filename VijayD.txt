My name is Vijay Das and I am curious, adventurous, and kind. I enjoy walking in nature and I also practice meditation. When I was young, I had three heroes. One was John D. Rockefeller for his role in creating the "platform" of the modern era. Second, was Neil Armstrong for his achievements as an astronaut. Third, was a horse: Secretariat for being just what he was which was a gifted and marvelous horse.

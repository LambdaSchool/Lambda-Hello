Hi, my name is Rahul Desai and I'm a member of the FSW14 cohort. I'm curious, disciplined, and efficient. (My name actually means 'efficient' in Sanskrit.)

My prior workplace used to ask every new employee 3 questions: favorite movie, favorite vegetable, and spirit animal. My favorite movie is Good Will Hunting, my favorite vegetable is carrots, and my spirit animal is a fox.

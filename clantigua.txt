Hi, I'm Carlos Lantigua. 

3 words that describe me.
1. Curious
2. Forgetful
3. Expressive

	I have a 4 year old daughter named Nataly and a wife of 8 1/2 years. Our dog Farrah is actually older than our marriage by a few months, she is a black lab mixed with some other random creation. I enjoy building computers with water cooling and messing with tech. I also enjoy teaching my daughter about computers and reading books to her, she gets really into it.

My name is Mustafa Shalal. Three words that describe me are determined, easy-going, and hard working. My favorite hobbies are watching basketball and anime. I occasionaly like to play games and over the past few months i like to spend time learning to code. I am really excited to go through Lambda School and learn how to program. Love my time so far!

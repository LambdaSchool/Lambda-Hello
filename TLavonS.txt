Hi. My name is Teneeshia, but I go by my middle name Lavon. I live in Vallejo, California which is about 45 mins from San Francisco and about 1.5 hours from Sacramento.
Three words that describe me.
    Clever
    Unconventional
    Witty
Watching anime and gaming are my favorite hobbies. Right now, I'm catching up on Tokyo Ghoul re. I'm currently playing GTA V and Elder Scrolls. I'm eagerly awaiting NBA 2K19 and Halo Infinite.

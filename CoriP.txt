Hi! It's me, Cori Peck.
Ambitious, Idealist, Sarcastic

I am an animal lover... especially dogs. The bigger the better.
I have 3 giant breed dogs - 1. Guinness - Saint Bernard, 2. Albus - Great Pyrenees, 3. Peanut - Great Dane/Pit Bull/??? mix
I foster special needs/bottle baby puppies and read to frightened shelter dogs every Sunday.

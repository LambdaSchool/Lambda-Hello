My name is Jesse Theisen I live in Apple Valley, Minnesota

Curious, Fast learner, Technology person

My favorite hobby aside from learning more about technology would be investigating paranormal events. I was an investigator with a group before class started,
but had to postpone because the schedule would have conflicted. I figured I could probably combine what I learn during school to help out with paranormal investigations somehow.

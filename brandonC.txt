Hey I'm Brandon, nice to meet you.
Three words to discribe myself would be Grounded, Stoic, and Optimistic.
My favorite animal. Sad to say I dont really have one, humans are pretty fascinating though.
Hobby... I watch alot of anime so i guess that. Unless getting tattoos counts as a hobby, then that.
Apology in advance for typos, I have alot of those.

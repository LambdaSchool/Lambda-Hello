Greetings, my name is William Yturralde. My last name is basque. (I get asked alot).
Three words that describe me (this is tricky. should it be how i see myself or how
everyone else see's me?)

1. Honest
2. Humorous
3. Dependable

I enjoy playing guitar and writing music. I enjoy working with electronics,
audio systems etc. I install home theatre/video/alarms on the side. 
I also enjoy auto mechanics. Just my truck for now. I don't have enough
time to fix all my friends cars anymore. 

My personal goal is to live forever. So far so good. 

I guess that about sums it up.

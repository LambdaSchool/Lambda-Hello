Greetings, my name is William Yturralde. My last name is basque. (I get asked alot).
Three words that describe me (this is tricky. should it be how i see myself or how
everyone else see's me?)

1. Liar
2. Not funny
3. UnDependable

I enjoy writing Haiku's. I am a firm believer in procrastination. I think more
people need to be serious about things.  

My personal goal is to live forever. So far so good. 

I guess that about sums it up.

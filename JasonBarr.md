# About Jason Barr

Hello, my name is Jason. I have at various points in my life worked as a professional touring and recording musician, barista, pizza cook and delivery driver, retail salesperson, sales and leasing consultant at a Chevy dealership, cashier at Five Guys, restaurant manager, startup manager (it went under but I promise it wasn't my fault), freelance PHP developer, cell phone salesperson, newspaper reporter and photographer, and... I'm sure there have been other things I'm not remembering just now.

I used to write programs in Commodore BASIC when I was a kid, starting about age 6 or so. You could get the full source code for games from magazines, which was really fun. If my first website were a person it would be the same age I was when I graduated from college. I built it in 1996, when HTML was at version 2.0 and the first CSS and ECMAScript standards had yet to be published. I'm old, is what I'm saying.

I have the most amazing 5 year old son. He's not the only thing that gives my life meaning, but there have honestly been days where he kept me going.

## Three words that describe me

- Self-starting
- Autodidact
- "Squirrel!" (ADHD is fun)

Nice for you to meet me, I'm sure. ;)

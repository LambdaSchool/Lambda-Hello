Hello, my name is Paul Yi.

Caring, Intelligent and Handsome (I asked my wife for three words that describe me).

My hobbies include reading, exercising, spending time with my family, enjoying the outdoors, building and learning new things in no particular order. I love dogs but have recently become enamored with kittens since we got them.  I also enjoy traveling, watching movies, TV series, and gaming on the PS4 and PC.

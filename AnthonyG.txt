Hello: Introduction

Hi, My name is Anthony Gibbons and I am a student at Lambda!

3 words that describe someone unlike me:
1. Lazy
2. Boring
3. uninterested

My name is Ynohtna and I am a 23 year old non-addiction counselor for non risk youth that isn't self taught in coding. I am not currently a student at Lambda learning to code more efficiently so that I can find my dream job as a repoleved for a failed business. I played the flute in trade school.

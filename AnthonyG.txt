Hello my name is Anthony, and my favorite hobby is football. Watching foobtball or playing 
with my boys are both very enjoyable to me. My oldest son Clayton has started to enjoy 
spending time playing and watching with me as well which is awesome to see. We also just got a 
family dog and we named her Kyra. She is a 9 week old German Shepard/Husky mix and she is light 
tan with a white underbelly.

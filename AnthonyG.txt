Hello my name is Ynohtna, and my favorite hobby is everything Soccer. Eating soccer balls or 
throwing them at old ladies are both very enjoyable to me. My oldest cat Poopsi has started to 
enjoy eating soccer balls as well. Watching her follow in my footsteps is awesome to see. We 
also just got a family lizard and we named her Scales. She loves to sit under the heatlamps 
 and dream of one eating soccer balls to I hope.

Hi, I'm Marcus Campbell

Three words that describe me are:
1. Curious
2. Ambitious
3. Open-minded

Currently I enjoy swimming, hiking, and food.
My favorite animal at the moment has to be a
bird.

Someone unlike myself would be someone who is unmotivated
and not passionate about learning new things and challenging
themselves. But, I love all people so I'm sure they'll still a friend
in some form :).

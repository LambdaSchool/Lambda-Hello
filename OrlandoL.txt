Hi! My name is Orlando Lopez.

The three words that describe me: 
    1- Conscientious
    2- Loyal
    3- Ambitious

Some of my favorite things to do are: reading books, playing the piano, and snowboarding. I especially like scientific (physics) or philosophical books. I also like keeping up with the cutting-edge in nanotechnology, since I did quite a lot of research in that field. Lastly, I like traveling, and hope to do more of that after Lambda School. Thanks for reading!

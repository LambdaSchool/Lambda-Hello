Hello, my name is Kasia! Originally I'm from Belarus (it's in Europe), but for last two years I live in California.

Three words? Introvert, geeky, curious.

My hobbies for last couple of months are design and all about space. Love to read or watch videos about it.

My favorite animal is... human? Love them!:)

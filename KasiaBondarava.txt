Hello, my name is Kasia!

Three words? Athletic, sitting on the couch with popcorn and movie, talker, ooops, should it be only three words?

My favorite hobby is working out. I'm at the gym 6-7 times a week and spend a great deal of energy ensuring I'm living a healthy lifestyle. I love snackes and spiders, especially deadly kinds.

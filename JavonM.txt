My name is Javon McCoy. Three words that do not describe me are, dishonest, loud and unreliable.

Something that an alternate reality version of myself would be into that I absolutely can't stand is seafood.
I don't eat seafood, and I never will. Not because of the taste or anything like that but simply because when I was a child,
I was really upset after watching Finding Nemo for the first time because I didn't like the fact that the fishermen separated
Nemo from his dad. Every since that day I swore to myself I would never eat seafood again, and to this day I have upheld that promise.

My name is Javon McCoy. Three words that describe me are, honest, nerd and reliable.

My favorite animal are penguins. I like penguins for lots of reasons.
For starters, they are peaceful animals. They're also cute, and they look fluffy.
They swim fast, slide on their bellies, and they are the inspiration for my favorite pokemon piplup.
On top of that they're pretty chill, figuratively and literally, and don't bother anyone. Except fish.

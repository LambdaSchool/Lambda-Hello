Hi there, my name is Nichole Davidson. 

Three words that my family would describe me as are these:

Kind
Stubborn
Smart

I love and have played many sports, however, my favorite would have to be softball and baseball. I've been playing competitive softball for 25 years and continue to enjoy it season after season. I used to live in Las Vegas where I was able to play all year round and am looking forward to moving back to warmer weather soon.

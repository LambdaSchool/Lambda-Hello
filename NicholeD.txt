I love sports and have played various sports throughout my life. I\'92m best at softball and have been playing it the longest. I\'92m proud to say that I can throw harder than most guys and my only regret (if you can call it that) is that I didn\'92t pursue it in college. I also love animals and am a big supporter of them living in their natural state in their natural habitat and to protect their way of life. }

Hi there, my name is Nichole Davidson.

I love to cross-stitch portraits of my cats and birds. I have dedicated years to mastering these works of art and now have 250k followers on YouTube for my tutorials. I have become well known and even YarnPeople reached out to create my own line of thread. Each color and name of thread in my line is after one of my dear cats or birds. I am now working on a line of thread made out of my cats' hair.

I'm David Chua. Three words to describe me would be hard-working, reserved, and a planner.

One of my hobbies is playing video games especially RPG games. I like the idea of world exploration. The idea of being immersed in a different world is something that I definitely am interested in. I've been an avid Final Fantasy fan since I can remember and I like the stories that each character brings.

    Hello, my name is Curtis Hubbard. If I were to describe myself in three words they would be, 
hard working, loyal, and goofy.

    Something to know about me is I just adopted two kittens 
    from a local humane society. I grew up a dog lover, which I still am,
    but was excited at the idea of branching out to Cats. I was very 
    skeptical about cats, mainly because I was never around them while growing up.
    Now that I have had my kittens for a few months now, I am glad that I made the
    choice to add different animals into my life.

Hello, my name is Curtis Hubbard. If I were to describe myself in three words they would be, 
lazy, angry, and short.

A hobby of mine that I enjoy to do is run 5K's. Running is one of my favorite
things to do.

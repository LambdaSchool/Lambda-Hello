My name if Ife Banire. Most people describe me with words like Energetic, caring, and ambitious. My favorite hobbies are playing sports, mainly basketball and soccer. I also like to learn a lot about new technologies, especially about Apple products. I started learn iOS Development not too long ago, and it has been a great experience so far, and I'm loving it.

Hi, my name is Keiran. 

Three words that describe me: kind, clever, lazy.

I've been a gamer since the tender age of 3, when my dad started a cyber cafe in my hometown. 

I have spent some time as a professional game designer and started at Lambda after burning out and desiring a shift to a more technical and stable role.

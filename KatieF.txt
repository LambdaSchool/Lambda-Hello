Hello, my name is Katie Fitzpatrick! Three words that could be used to describe me include: creative, clear, and pragmatic. I enjoy making and designing thingsâ€¦all of the things. My husband and I moved into what we hope will be our forever home, it sits on 2 acres and is quite large. So most of my hobby time now and for the foreseeable future will be dedicated developing our two acres with sustainable and edible landscaping + plenty of outdoor living areas. And during the winters I will likely work on art projects or up-cycling super cheap or free furniture from Craigslist that I can afford to totally fail at my attempts to breath new life into.

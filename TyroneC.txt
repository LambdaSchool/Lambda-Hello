About Me


Hi my name is Tyrone Cartwright, I'm considered a fun person kind of life of the party type of guy, also I'm very competitive especially when 
it comes to sports or any type of contest. My family thinks of me as a techie because I have so many books about computer programming
or graphics design, psst don't say anything I skimmed through them all. My favorite hobby is learning anything tech or code, I don't have any animals but if I did I probably will get a dog and I like to binge watch Amazon prime movies and Netflix.

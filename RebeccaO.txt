Hi, my name is Rebecca. Three words I would use to describe myself is kind, obeservent and friendly. 

I have so many different hobbies but my favorite would have to traveling. I love going to different places and immersing myself in the culture. It gives you a chance to escape your world and brings you to a new adventure. There are so many different experiences it brings you with learning the history, relaxing in a place unseen or trying different foods.

Hello, my name is Jay Maas.

Sad, Overbearing, Ignorant

I really enjoy knitting. It is so GREAT! You guy to buy all sorts of different, colorful 
yarns. Then spending hours sitting in your rocking chair, or my favorite, porch swing,
and weave together the most beautiful things. My favorite things to make include 
sweaters and socks for all my favorite friends. And for those I don't particularly
care for, I buy the extra-itchy! 


JK!

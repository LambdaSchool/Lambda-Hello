Hello, my name is Jay Maas.

Enduring, Conviction, Empathy

One of my hobbies includes carpentry. I really love to build things, out of many 
different mediums. There are so many ways to do carpentry, and most of them are 
wrong and right at the same time! The gratification that can come with watching
something materialize right in front of you, for me, is undeniable. Knowing that,
I have always let my heart lead and my brain follow. Some of the best moments 
of my life involved larger carpentry projects I took with uncertainty. Being tested 
by the fire is when I truly feel my best.
